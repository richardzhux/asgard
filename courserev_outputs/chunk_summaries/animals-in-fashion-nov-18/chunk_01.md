**Animals in (Human) Fashion – Hats, Fur, Fabric (11/18/2025)**  

---

### 1. Sumptuary Laws and Fur Hierarchy
**Key concept:** Laws controlling who could wear what clothing/furs.

- **Sumptuary laws**
  - Restricted use of luxury materials (e.g., specific furs, silk) to elites.
  - Common in medieval and early modern Europe.
  - Commoners allowed only “low-status” furs:
    - Goat, sheep, cat, dog, rabbit.
  - **Example:** Tudor regulations (England) specifying which ranks could wear certain furs and fabrics.

**Pitfall / confusion:**  
- These laws didn’t ban fur for commoners entirely; they limited *which* animals’ furs and *which qualities* of fur could be worn.

### 2. North American Fur Trade Origins
**Key concept:** Fur trade grew out of early fisheries.

- **Codfish trade link**
  - European fishermen came to North America primarily for cod.
  - While fish dried on shore, they:
    - Traded European goods (knives, hooks, cloth) with Indigenous peoples.
    - Exchanged for **pelts**, especially beaver.
- Led to:
  - Extensive **trans-Native trading networks** in the interior.
  - Furs moved long distances before reaching European traders.

### 3. Case 1 – Beaver (Castor fiber, Castor canadensis)
**Species:**
- *Castor fiber* – Eurasian beaver.
- *Castor canadensis* – North American beaver (main species in colonial trade).

**Historical importance:**
- Quote: North American beaver was “likely the most widespread and successful mammal on the continent” at time of early European exploration (Eric Jay Dolin, *Fur, Fortune, and Empire*).
- Beaver pelts were central to European hat-making (felt hats).

**Beaver pelt grades (for hat-making):**
1. **Coat beaver (castor sec)**
   - Definition: Pelts that had already been worn as part of robes/clothing for at least a year.
   - Advantage: Natural **guard hairs already worn away**, leaving softer underfur that felts more easily.
   - Most desirable for fine felt hats.

2. **Parchment beaver (also called castor sec in some sources)**
   - Definition: Freshly prepared beaver skins, ready for trade and transport.
   - Still have **guard hairs**.
   - Guard hairs must be **plucked** before felting.

**Pitfalls / common confusions:**
- “Castor sec” is sometimes used generically; context matters:
  - Here it’s used for both “coat beaver” and “parchment beaver,” but the *condition* (worn vs fresh) and hair status (guard hairs removed vs present) differ.
- People often assume “new” fur is best quality; for felt hats, *used* (“coat”) beaver was actually superior.

### 4. From Beaver to Silk
**Key concept (implied):** Shift in hat materials over time.
- Early modern: Beaver felt dominated.
- Later: Silk (and other fibers) increasingly substituted for beaver, especially as beaver became scarcer and fashions changed.

---

### 5. Case 2 – Feathers and Millinery
**Millinery fashions (hat-making):**
- Used more than just single feathers:
  - **Wings, heads, claws**, entire birds or large parts.
  - Materials often **dyed** and carefully **posed** for decorative effect.
- Created a massive demand for wild birds, driving some species toward extinction.

**Common confusion:**
- People may think only loose feathers were used; in fashion, whole bodies/parts were regularly mounted on hats.

---

### 6. Legal Response to Feather/Fur Millinery
**Key legislative milestones (U.S.-centered):**

- **1886–1909: American Ornithologists’ Union (AOU) model laws**
  - AOU drafted model bird-protection laws.
  - Many U.S. states passed versions to restrict hunting and plume trade.

- **1900: Lacey Act**
  - Banned **interstate trade in illegally taken wildlife** (including animal parts).
  - Important as one of the **first federal wildlife laws**.
  - Enforcement example: Seizure of **2600 gulls** from a millinery shop in Baltimore.

- **1900–1905: “Thayer Fund”**
  - Philanthropic fund to hire more **game wardens**, especially for seabird protection.
  - Strengthened enforcement of existing bird laws.

- **1903–1906: Voluntary millinery restrictions**
  - Some milliners agreed not to use certain feathers (especially from threatened bird species).
  - Shows early industry self-regulation under public pressure.

- **1913: Underwood Tariff Bill**
  - Import ban on:
    > “the feathers, quills, heads, wings, tails, skins, or parts of skins, of wild birds, either raw or manufactured, and not for scientific or educational purposes”
  - **Exceptions:** Ostrich feathers, domestic fowl.
  - Targeted the **fashion trade in wild bird parts**.

- **1913: Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) – date nuance**
  - Slide lists 1913; historically, the MBTA is usually dated **1918** (implementing a 1916 US–UK/Canada treaty).
  - Core purpose: Protect migratory birds; restrict hunting and commercial trade in their parts.

**Pitfall / confusion:**
- MBTA date:
  - Remember: treaty (1916), implementing U.S. law (1918).
  - A slide showing “1913” may refer to related legislation or be an oversimplification.

### 7. Case 3 – Fur, Leather, Wool?
- Slide only titles this case; content not shown.
- Implied question: How do we treat other animal-derived materials (fur, leather, wool) in comparison to feathers/fashion furs?
  - Ethical/legal debates continue over:
    - Wild vs domestic animals.
    - Necessity vs luxury.
    - Fashion vs functional uses.

---

**Overall themes to remember:**
- Clothing and fashion have been powerful **drivers of animal exploitation** (fur, feathers, skins).
- Legal and social responses gradually emerged:
  - From **sumptuary laws**
