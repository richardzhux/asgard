# Chunk 01 (units 1-302)

Key concepts / sections
- Emergency Aid Doctrine (State v. Hershey)
- Search and Seizure (State v. Newcomb; OR Const. art. I, § 9 & U.S. Const. 4th Amend.)
- Property Rights vs. Statutory Protections (dominion/control vs. neglect obligations)
- Criminal neglect cases: Martínez v. State of Texas; People v. Riazati

Definitions / rules

1. Emergency Aid Doctrine (Hershey; with Fessenden/Dicke)
- Rule: Entry onto property without a warrant or probable cause that a crime has been committed is permissible if:
  - The officer reasonably believes they must enter to “render immediate aid to persons who have suffered, or who are imminently threatened with suffering, serious physical injury or harm.”
- Extension to animals (Fessenden/Dicke):
  - Same principle can apply to animals “unless that injury or death is being inflicted lawfully.”
  - Starvation is not a lawful basis for animal injury/death.
- Exigent circumstances for animals:
  - Whether/when this exception applies is state-dependent.

2. Search and Seizure (State v. Newcomb)
- Oregon Constitution, Art. I, § 9:
  - Protects people against unreasonable searches or seizures of their “persons, houses, papers, and effects.”
  - Warrants require probable cause, oath/affirmation, and particular description of place and person/thing to be seized.
- U.S. Constitution, 4th Amendment:
  - Parallel protection at the federal level with nearly identical warrant requirements.
- Key point: State constitutional analysis (like in Newcomb) may give more or different protection than the federal baseline.

3. Property Rights vs. Statutory Protections
- Rights of Dominion and Control:
  - Traditional property rights: the ability to control and use one’s property (including animals).
- Custody or Control:
  - Legal focus in neglect statutes is often on who has “custody or control,” not just legal title.
  - Distinct from “lawful possession or custody”: you can be responsible for an animal’s welfare even if you don’t own it or aren’t the formal custodian.
- Examining the “Interior”:
  - Idea that the state can scrutinize what happens “inside” the sphere of private property when statutory duties (like animal welfare) are implicated.
- Obligations of “Minimal Care”:
  - Statutes can impose baseline duties of care toward animals, based on “legal and social norms.”
  - Property rights are limited by these statutory welfare obligations.

Cases and doctrines

4. Martínez v. State of Texas, 48 S.W.3d 273 (2001)
- Highlights:
  - Prosecutorial discretion: prosecutors choose whether and how to charge neglect or cruelty.
  - Causes of neglect: can include omission (failure to provide minimal care), not just affirmative abuse.
  - Mens rea: statute requires conduct “intentionally or knowingly” (key for criminal liability).
    - “Intentionally”: conscious objective to engage in conduct or cause result.
    - “Knowingly”: awareness that conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.
- Relevance: defines the threshold between unfortunate circumstances and criminally blameworthy neglect.

5. People v. Riazati, 198 Cal. App. 4th 514 (2011)
- Used in course as another neglect/cruelty case.
- Likely focuses on how California balances:
  - Property rights in animals
  - Statutory duties of care
  - Proof of mental state (intent/knowledge) and what qualifies as neglect.

Examples (implicit)
- Animal starvation:
  - Explicitly noted as not a lawful form of killing/allowing animal death.
  - Thus can justify emergency entry and intervention under the emergency aid doctrine (in jurisdictions that extend it to animals).

Common pitfalls / confusions
- Thinking a warrant or probable cause of a crime is always required:
  - Emergency aid doctrine allows warrantless entry to render immediate aid to persons (and sometimes animals), independent of probable cause that a crime has occurred.
- Assuming property rights are absolute:
  - Dominion/control over animals is constrained by statutory “minimal care” obligations.
- Confusing ownership with legal responsibility:
  - “Custody or control” can create legal obligations even without formal ownership.
- Ignoring mens rea in neglect:
  - Many neglect statutes require “intentionally or knowingly”; simple negligence, ignorance, or poverty-related failures may not meet the criminal standard (fact-specific).
- Overgeneralizing animal exigent-circumstances rules:
  - Application to animals and standards for emergency entry/aid vary by state constitutional law and precedent.
