# Chunk 01 (units 1-411)

**Key Concepts / Sections**

- **State v. Cleve (N.M. 1999)**  
  • Referenced as a key case on interpreting state anti-cruelty statutes (details not in this chunk, but know it as a leading NM case).

- **New Mexico Cruelty Statute (NMSA 1978, §30-18-1)**  
  Cruelty to animals consists of:
  - **§A**:  
    • Torturing, tormenting  
    • Depriving of necessary sustenance  
    • Cruelly beating  
    • Mutilating  
    • Cruelly killing  
    • Overdriving any animal  
  - **§B**:  
    • Unnecessarily failing to provide any animal with proper food or drink  
  - **§C**:  
    • Cruelly driving or working any animal when unfit for labor  

- **Navigating Cruelty Laws – Core Questions**
  1. **Which animals are protected?**  
     • Companion, domestic, livestock, formerly wild, currently wild  
  2. **Why are they protected?**  
     • Moral concern, property interests, public order, etc.  
  3. **How does their protection benefit humans?**  
     • “The Link” to other violence, public health/safety, property protection  
  4. **When/where are they protected (context)?**  
     • Home, farm, lab, hunting field, entertainment venue, etc.

- **Common Elements of State Anti-Cruelty Laws**
  - **Reporting & Cross-Reporting**
    • Animal abuse and child abuse investigations often linked  
    • Veterinarians may be mandatory reporters  
  - **Penalties**
    • Typically criminal: misdemeanors and/or felonies  
  - **Sentencing Options**
    • Community service  
    • Counseling/psychological treatment  
    • Reimbursement for cost of care of seized animals (sometimes pre‑conviction)  
    • Restitution if animal belonged to someone else  

- **Context-Based Exceptions (Where Cruelty Laws Often Don’t Apply or Are Narrowed)**
  - **Veterinary Medicine**
    • Exemptions for “traditional veterinary practices” (state-defined)  
    • “Animal” usually broadly defined, but practice-based carve-outs.
  - **Research Animals**
    • Covered at minimum by the **Animal Welfare Act (AWA)** (note: AWA excludes many species such as most lab rats/mice and farm animals in research).  
  - **Hunting, Fishing, Trapping**
    • Regulated separately under wildlife laws  
    • Sometimes preempted by federal statutes (Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act).
  - **Livestock**
    • Exemptions for “standard animal husbandry practices” (industry norms)  
    • Slaughter governed by the **Humane Slaughter Act** (limited scope).  
  - **Pest Control**
    • Often carved out or weakly regulated.
  - **Entertainment**
    • Activities allowed if “pursuant to state law” (e.g., rodeos, some circuses)  
    • Captive wildlife in entertainment may be covered by the AWA.

- **ALDF State Rankings**
  - Animal Legal Defense Fund ranks states by strength of animal protection laws (context for comparing statutory protection and enforcement).

**Key Definition / Interpretation: People v. Garcia, 812 N.Y.S.2d 66 (2006)**

- **Issue:** Is a goldfish a “companion animal”/domesticated animal under the statute?
- **Holding/Reasoning:**
  - Legislature **did not require “reciprocity of affection”** in the definition.  
    → Animal does not need to love or bond back with the human.
  - “Domesticated” = **“to adapt (an animal or plant) to life in intimate association with and to the advantage of humans.”**  
    → A goldfish adapted to live in a home for human enjoyment qualifies as domesticated.
  - Legislative concern is **the perpetrator’s state of mind (mens rea)**, not the victim animal’s emotional capacity.  

- **Example From Case:**
  - A goldfish was found to be a **domesticated companion animal** under New York law, so cruelty charges could apply.

**Common Pitfalls / Confusions**

- **Assuming “all animals” are equally protected.**  
  Coverage varies by category (companion vs. livestock vs. wildlife vs. lab animals), and many practices are exempted as “standard” or “traditional.”

- **Thinking animal must be affectionate or sentient “enough” to count.**  
  As in *Garcia*, the statute focuses on **human use/domestication** and **defendant’s intent**, not on animal’s capacity to reciprocate affection.

- **Assuming AWA is comprehensive.**  
  It sets **minimal** standards and excludes many animals; it also does not ban many painful practices that are “standard.”

- **Overlooking context-based carve-outs.**  
  Activities like hunting, research, pest control, or routine farm practices may be partially or fully outside general cruelty laws.

- **Ignoring “The Link.”**
