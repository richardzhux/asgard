# Chunk 06 (units 4101-4265)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - **Merger of offenses**: Whether multiple guilty verdicts should be merged into fewer convictions when arising from the same statutory provision.
  - **Unit of prosecution**: How many separately punishable offenses exist when a single act/statutory violation affects multiple victims.
  - **Role of precedent when vacated**: Use of reasoning from a case (Nix) that was later vacated on jurisdictional grounds.

- **Definitions / rules**
  - **Separately punishable offenses per victim**:  
    When one act violates a *single* statutory provision but involves **two or more victims**, there are **as many separately punishable offenses as there are victims**.
  - **Effect of vacatur on reasoning**:  
    A decision vacated for **lack of jurisdiction** may **lose precedential force** but courts can still find its **reasoning persuasive** and adopt it, as in Hess adopting Nix.

- **Examples**
  - **Hess case**:
    - Defendant convicted of **45 counts of animal neglect**.
    - Argument: These should merge because they all arose from violating the same statute.
    - Holding: No merger; **each animal** is treated as a **separate victim**, so **45 separate convictions** are proper.
    - Court explicitly **adopts Nix’s reasoning** on the merger question, despite Nix having been vacated.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **“One statute = one crime” misconception**:  
    Students may think a single statutory violation equals a single offense. Here, the *number of victims* controls how many offenses exist, even under **one** statutory provision.
  - **Vacated decisions and binding precedent**:  
    - Vacated cases (like Nix) are **not binding precedent**.
    - Courts may still **cite and adopt** their reasoning as persuasive authority, leading to confusion about their status.
  - **Merger vs. sentencing**:  
    - Merger is about whether multiple guilty verdicts become **one conviction**.
    - This is distinct from questions about **concurrent vs. consecutive sentences**, which are **sentencing** issues, not merger issues.
