Travis v. Murray, 977 N.Y.S.2d 621 (2013) – Replevin
- Key concept: Replevin
  - Definition: A cause of action for wrongful taking or wrongful detention of chattel (personal property).
  - Remedy:
    - Court issues a writ of replevin.
    - Can be provisional (pending final decision) or permanent.
    - Used to recover the actual item (the chattel) from the wrongfully possessing party.
    - Focus is on return of the specific thing, not on monetary damages for its loss.

- Example:
  - In pet disputes (as in Travis v. Murray), the party seeking to get the pet back uses replevin to recover the animal as property.

- Common confusions:
  - Replevin vs damages: Replevin is about getting the thing back, not about being paid for its value.
  - Provisional vs permanent writ: provisional can change after full hearing.

In re Capers Estate, 34 Pa. D&C2d 122 (Pa. Orphans’ Ct. 1964) – Cy pres
- Key concept: Cy pres doctrine (“cy près comme possible” – “as near as possible”)
  - Definition: A common-law doctrine used to modify charitable trusts (and sometimes testamentary instructions) when the original terms are illegal, impossible, or impracticable to carry out.
  - Function:
    - Court alters the terms to approximate as closely as possible the intent of the testator or settlor.
    - Requires a petition to the court (usually by the trustee) to apply cy pres.

- Example (general structure):
  - If a will leaves money “to support a now-illegal type of institution,” a court may redirect funds to a similar lawful institution that fulfills the same broad purpose.

- Common confusions:
  - Cy pres is about adjusting *how* the intent is carried out, not ignoring the intent.
  - Usually applies to charitable-type purposes, not ordinary private gifts.

Pet Trusts – UTC vs UPC Approaches

1. Uniform Trust Code (UTC) § 408 – Care for an Animal
   - Scope:
     - Trust can provide for the care of an animal alive during the settlor’s lifetime.
     - Terminates at the death of the last surviving covered animal.
   - Enforcement:
     - By a person named in the trust or someone appointed by the court.
     - Other interested parties may ask the court to appoint/replace the enforcement person.
   - Funding limits:
     - Court can reduce the amount in the trust if it exceeds what is needed for the animal’s care.
     - Excess goes to the “successors in interest” (people who would take under the instrument or otherwise after the trust ends).

2. Uniform Probate Code (UPC) § 2-907 – Honorary Trusts; Trusts for Pets
   - Scope:
     - Trusts for the care of any designated domestic or pet animals.
     - Terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust.
   - Enforcement:
     - By person named, or someone appointed by the court.
     - Outsiders may ask the court to appoint an enforcer; court may modify as needed to effect the transferor’s intent.
   - Funding limits:
     - Court may reduce the amount if it “substantially exceeds” the needs.
     - Distribution order for excess:
       1. As directed by the trust instrument.
       2. According to the decedent’s will.
       3. According to intestate heirs (if no will provision).

- Common confusions / comparison points:
  - Both UTC and UPC:
    - Recognize valid trusts for animal care.
    - Allow an enforcer (designated or court-appointed).
    - Allow courts to reduce overfunded pet trusts.
  - Differences to watch:
    - Language: UTC speaks of animals alive during settlor’s lifetime; UPC refers to “designated domestic or pet animals” more broadly.
    - Distribution of excess:
      - UTC: to “successors in interest” (look to the trust instrument / default trust law).
      - UPC: explicit order—trust directions → will → heirs.
    - Standard for reduction:
      - UTC: “exceeds what’s needed.”
      - UPC: “substantially exceeds” needs (slightly higher threshold).
