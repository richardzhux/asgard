Key concepts / sections
- Heuristics and risk perception
- Probability neglect (Sunstein)
- Application to BSL (breed-specific legislation)
- Misallocation of resources
- Role of the media in amplifying fear

Definitions
- Availability heuristic  
  Our estimate of how likely an event is depends on how easily we can recall vivid examples of it. Easily recalled = we think it’s more likely than it really is.

- Affect heuristic  
  Our judgments of risk are heavily influenced by our emotional reaction (fear, anxiety). Strong negative feelings → we overestimate risk.

- Probability neglect (Sunstein)  
  When emotions are intense, people focus on the bad outcome itself and largely ignore how unlikely it is.  
  - Result: “Worst-case scenarios” dominate thinking, and people demand legal/regulatory action even when the probability is very low.

Key points
- Overestimation vs. underestimation of risks  
  - Vivid, emotionally charged, or heavily publicized dangers → risk overestimated.  
  - Commonplace, non-salient, or hard-to-visualize dangers → risk underestimated.

- Probability neglect affects everyone  
  - Not just private individuals; also: regulators, judges, legislators, and other public officials.

- Public fear as a policy consideration  
  - Sunstein & Kahneman: public fear is itself a form of harm and should not be dismissed.  
  - Laws that *rationally* reduce both actual risk and fear are desirable.

Application to BSL (Breed-Specific Legislation)
- Mechanism:
  - A severe dog attack (often involving pit bulls), especially with heavy media coverage → triggers availability & affect heuristics.
  - Public and officials neglect the low probability of another such incident.
  - Strong emotional response → intense political demand to “do something,” often via BSL.

- Problems with BSL in this context:
  - May reduce fear but has little/no effect on actual risk of dog bites or fatalities.  
  - Can create a *false sense of security* so people lower their guard, potentially increasing risk.  
  - Even in communities with pit bull bans, dog bites and attack fatalities still occur.

- Economic/administrative costs:
  - Example: Prince George’s County, Maryland  
    - BSL enforcement (seizure, impoundment, maintenance of pit bulls) cost > $500,000 annually.  
    - Up to ~$68,000 per animal from seizure to euthanasia.  
    → Task force concluded BSL was an inefficient use of resources.

Misallocation of resources
- Overemphasis on small risks, underemphasis on larger ones → resources diverted away from where they are most needed.
- Sunstein’s shark-attack example:
  - Summer 2001: huge media coverage of shark attacks (“summer of the shark”), despite:
    - Exceedingly low probability of attack.
    - No reliable evidence of an actual increase in attacks.
  - Led to discussions and adoption of regulations for a minuscule risk.

Role of the media
- Media tends to:
  - Highlight “worst-case scenario” events.
  - Sensationalize rare, emotionally gripping incidents.
- Effect:
  - Activates availability and affect heuristics.
  - Fuels probability neglect and public demand for regulation of low-probability harms.
  - Shapes perceived risk more than actual statistical risk.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing *fear intensity* with *actual probability*: feeling very afraid does not mean the event is likely.
- Assuming that any law that reduces public fear is justified:  
  - Need to check whether it also meaningfully reduces actual risk and uses resources efficiently.
- Believing that banning a high-profile risk source (e.g., pit bulls) eliminates the underlying risk category (dog attacks).
