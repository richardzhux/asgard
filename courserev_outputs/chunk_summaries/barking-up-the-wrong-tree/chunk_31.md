# Chunk 31 (units 24601-25500)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - **Unreliability of visual breed identification**
    - Testimony in *Toledo v. Tellings*: dog warden used the dog’s “look,” not actual breed, to decide if it was a “pit bull” and thus “vicious.”
    - Voith et al. study: 923 participants (including canine professionals) did **not** agree on breed based on appearance; even wrong answers were not consistent.
    - This undermines:
      - Consistent enforcement of laws that rely on “looks like a pit bull.”
      - The factual basis of breed-specific legislation (BSL) and attack statistics by “breed.”

  - **Attorney General Bryant’s argument for Ontario’s Bill 132 (pit bull ban)**
    - Claimed “most people know what a pit bull is,” and if it “walks/barks/bites/wags” like a pit bull, it is a pit bull.
    - Claimed “everybody knows what kind of dog they own” and can show papers if it’s not a pit bull.
    - The article identifies **two major errors**:
      1. Assumes people can reliably identify pit bulls by sight (Voith study shows this is false).
      2. Assumes most owners have pedigree papers; many dogs are unregistered or mixed-breed with no documentation.

  - **Burden of proof on owners**
    - In BSL regimes, owners of dogs that *look* like pit bulls often must prove their dog is *not* a pit bull.
    - Without DNA testing (historically), it was nearly impossible to disprove a visual identification.

  - **Impact on breed-discrimination data (attack reports)**
    - Question raised: can we trust that historical dog attacks attributed to a specific “breed” actually involved that breed?
    - At attack scenes, no one checks registration papers or DNA; identifications are **eyewitness, subjective, and based on appearance** → inherently unreliable.
    - Thus, statistics that say “X breed is responsible for Y attacks” may be built on misidentifications.

  - **Psychology of fear and over-identification**
    - Cycle of discrimination:
      1. Breed becomes popular.
      2. A few attacks by that breed or by dogs that only “look like” that breed.
      3. Public and media fixate on frightening images → fear.
      4. People begin to **over-identify** that breed as the culprit in later incidents.
    - “Dangerous” breeds in public consciousness are:
      - Over-reported/over-identified in attacks.
      - Sometimes targeted with violence purely for how they look (no provocation).

- **Definitions / important ideas**
  - **Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**: Laws that regulate or ban certain dog breeds (e.g., “pit bulls”) presumed to be inherently dangerous.
  - **Visual Identification**: Judging a dog’s “breed” based only on physical appearance rather than registration records or DNA.

- **Examples**
  - *Toledo v. Tellings*: enforcement based purely on whether a dog “looked like a pit bull.”
  - Ontario’s Bill 132 debate: Bryant’s “if it walks like a pit bull…” quote used to justify a ban and to downplay misidentification concerns.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **Confusing “looks like” with actual breed**:
    - Many mixed-breed dogs can resemble pit bulls; appearance alone is not a reliable indicator of genetics.
  - **Assuming professionals are accurate**:
    - Even shelter staff, dog wardens, and other canine professionals frequently disagree on breed by sight.
  - **Taking attack statistics by breed at face value**:
    - If identification at the scene is unreliable, then breed-based risk statistics may be heavily distorted.
  - **Assuming owners know or can prove their dog’s breed**:
    - Many dogs lack papers; mixed-breed ancestry is often unknown, making “prove you don’t own a pit bull” requirements unfair and sometimes impossible.
