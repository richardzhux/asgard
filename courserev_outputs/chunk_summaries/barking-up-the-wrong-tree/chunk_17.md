# Chunk 17 (units 13121-14020)

Key concepts / sections
- Courts upholding Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL) under rational basis review  
- Use of questionable or debunked “expert” evidence about pit bulls  
- Development of “rational basis plus” / “rational basis with bite” in BSL challenges  
- Precedential entrenchment of early, weakly-supported decisions  

Definitions / doctrines
- Rational Basis Test:
  - Standard of review for most legislation under equal protection and due process.
  - Law is upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
  - Very deferential to government; does not require accurate or current science.

- “Rational basis plus” / “rational basis with bite”:
  - A somewhat more demanding variant of rational basis review.
  - Court more carefully examines whether the supposed facts supporting the law are accurate, non-pretextual, and not rooted in stereotypes.
  - Used by some courts (e.g., Ohio Court of Appeals in Toledo v. Tellings) in BSL contexts.

Key cases and what they held
- Colorado Dog Fanciers v. Denver (Dog Fanciers):
  - Upheld BSL; found pit bulls more dangerous (stronger, no warning, less likely to retreat, etc.).
  - Accepted generalized claims about pit bull behavior as sufficient for rational basis.
  - Cited as support for later BSL cases.

- Garcia v. Village of Tijeras:
  - Upheld a pit bull ban.
  - Relied on evidence that pit bulls supposedly have “inherent characteristics of aggression, strength, viciousness and unpredictability” not found in other breeds, can go into “berserk frenzies,” have twice the bite strength, and attack without warning.
  - These claims largely originated in 1980s media coverage and are now considered false or highly suspect.

- Starkey v. Chester Township (E.D. Pa. 1986):
  - Denied a preliminary injunction; predicted the ordinance would likely survive equal protection challenge under rational basis.
  - Relied on testimony like “the Pit Bull bites to kill without signal.”

- Hearn v. City of Overland Park (Kan. 1989):
  - Upheld pit bull ordinance against equal protection and vagueness challenges.
  - Found evidence that pit bulls have a strongly developed “kill instinct” and are more aggressive and destructive than other dogs.

- State v. Peters (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988):
  - Upheld ordinance against equal protection challenge even though it was underinclusive (didn’t include mixed-breed pit bulls).

- Garcia, Dog Fanciers, Starkey, Hearn, Peters:
  - Together form an early line of cases accepting weak or pseudo-scientific claims about pit bulls, yet repeatedly cited as precedent to uphold later BSL.

- Toledo v. Tellings (Ohio Court of Appeals – “Tellings I”):
  - Noted that past “vicious dog” cases of late 1980s/early 1990s relied on outdated information that perpetuated stereotypes about pit bulls.
  - Employed a more searching rational basis (“with bite”) and questioned prior factual assumptions.

- Later reliance:
  - American Canine Federation v. City of Aurora (D. Colo. 2008): relied on Dog Fanciers and Garcia.
  - West Virginia Supreme Court (2013): still citing the same old evidence to uphold a breed ban.

Examples of disputed claims about pit bulls (used as “evidence”)
- More likely to inflict severe damage than other breeds.  
- Have killed more people (e.g., “more Ohioans”) than any other breed.  
- Police fire at pit bulls more often than at people and all other dogs combined.  
- Frequently present in drug raids and thus more often shot.  
- Stronger bite (up to twice that of other dogs).  
- Display no warning signals before attacking; go into “berserk frenzies.”  
- Have unique “kill instinct” and are less likely to retreat even when in pain.

Key critique
- Much of the “evidence” underlying early BSL cases:
  - Originated from sensationalized media circa 1987.
  - Has been shown to be false, distorted, or unsubstantiated.
  - Nonetheless, because of precedent, these cases and their factual claims continue to be cited, creating a chain of decisions built on pseudo‑science.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing legal sufficiency with scientific accuracy:
  - Under traditional rational basis, courts can uphold laws based on assumptions or outdated beliefs as long as they are not utterly irrational; this does not mean the underlying dog behavior claims are true.

- Overlooking the impact of early precedent:
  - Once early courts accepted questionable “expert” testimony, later courts often cited those opinions instead of independently scrutinizing current scientific data.

- Vagueness vs. equal protection:
  - Some courts have held that “commonly available knowledge” about pit bull traits is enough to tell owners whether their dog is a pit bull, rejecting vagueness challenges.
  - This assumes laypeople, vets, and breeders can reliably identify pit bulls—disputed in later scholarship and cases.
