# Chunk 40 (units 31981-32880)

- **Key Concepts / Sections**

  - **Biases, predispositions, and heuristics**
    - Our prior beliefs, opinions, and experiences shape what we notice, remember, and find persuasive.
    - This interacts with the **availability heuristic**: we more easily recall examples that fit our biases, which then reinforces those same biases.

  - **Affect heuristic & priming**
    - If we’re “primed” to think positively/negatively about something, that affect tends to persist and influence later judgments.
    - Example: gun control debate  
      - Gun control advocates more readily recall gun crimes.  
      - Second Amendment advocates more readily recall defensive gun use stories.

  - **Social sharing and fear**
    - People rarely keep their fears and opinions to themselves; they share them, especially fears.
    - This social sharing can trigger **cascades**.

  - **Social cascades**
    - **Definition:** A process where people adopt and amplify the fears (or beliefs) of others in their social networks.
    - When people see others share a concern, they are more likely to adopt it and pass it on.
    - Media (traditional, new, social) all contribute, but close social networks often drive the strongest cascades.
    - Cascades **amplify fear** beyond the level justified by actual risk.

- **Examples**

  - **Child abduction**
    - Actual data:  
      - ~200,000 family abductions per year.  
      - ~115 stranger abductions of children under 18 per year.
    - Public fear: focuses heavily on strangers at bus stops, despite much lower risk than family abduction.

  - **Gun violence**
    - Most homicides occur in homes, not in schools or public mass shootings.
    - Public fear: disproportionately focused on school shootings or terrorist attacks.

  - **Ebola scare (2014)**
    - Fear spread via social networks; rational discussion of low actual risk in the U.S. was drowned out.
    - Contrast: **flu** and **MRSA** (antibiotic-resistant infections) pose far greater actual risks but receive much less fearful attention—treated as “background noise.”

- **Key Ideas about Risk and Fear**

  - All actions have some risk; cascades usually start from a real (but often small) risk.
  - New, unfamiliar dangers (e.g., Ebola) are more fear-inducing and more cascade-prone than familiar, everyday risks (e.g., flu).
  - Fears that tap into **strong emotion** or **moral outrage** are especially likely to cascade.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

  - **Confusing salience with probability:**  
    - Just because an event is vivid, shared widely, or frequently discussed doesn’t mean it’s likely.
  - **Over-trusting social proof:**  
    - Seeing many people afraid (online or offline) can feel like evidence of high risk, but it may reflect a cascade, not the true probability.
  - **Difficulty reversing fear with facts:**  
    - Presenting statistics and probabilities often does little to undo fear once a cascade has taken hold; sometimes “changing the subject” is more effective.
