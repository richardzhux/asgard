  - Availability heuristic and Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)
  - Hidden costs/risks of BSL
  - Affect heuristic
  - Inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit

- **Availability Heuristic**
  - **Definition**: People judge how likely something is based on how easily examples come to mind (what is “available” in memory).
  - **Context dependence**: What is “available” varies by person and culture; it is shaped by recent events and media coverage.
  - **Application to BSL**:
    - Communities with recent or vividly reported dog attacks are more likely to pass BSL.
    - Communities without such salient incidents are less likely to see a need for BSL.
  - **Pitfall**: Overemphasizes some risks (e.g., pit bull attacks) while obscuring others (e.g., harms caused by banning them). Less “available” ≠ less real or less serious.

- **Hidden Risks / Costs of BSL (Examples)**
  - **Emotional and psychological harm**:
    - People forced to surrender or euthanize beloved dogs (even service or therapy dogs).
    - Documented cases: suicide after forced euthanasia; lawsuits over pit bull service dogs.
  - **Housing and homelessness**:
    - Bans make it harder to obtain housing with certain breeds.
    - Example: families choosing homelessness over giving up a pit bull.
  - **Health and well-being**:
    - Pets provide stress relief, lower heart disease risk, and improve mental health.
    - Breeds targeted by BSL are also used as therapy and service dogs.
    - Removing these dogs can reduce owners’ physical and mental health benefits.
  - **Key confusion**: People focus on the salient risk of dog attacks and ignore less visible but serious harms to owners and communities.

- **Affect Heuristic**
  - **Definition**: Decisions are influenced by emotional reactions (positive or negative “affect”) triggered by images or cues.
  - **Subliminal priming example**:
    - Subjects shown a smiling or frowning face briefly before rating Chinese ideographs.
    - Ideographs following smiling faces were rated more “likable” than those following frowning faces.
    - Effect persisted even when later “primed” with the opposite face—initial affective impression was durable.
  - **Mechanism**:
    - Emotions act as a quick “tag” of good/bad that shapes judgments without conscious awareness.

- **Inverse Relationship Between Perceived Risk and Benefit**
  - **Observation**:
    - If people think an activity has high benefits, they tend to downplay its risks.
    - If they see it as highly risky, they tend to discount its benefits.
  - **Example mentioned**:
    - Nuclear power: public often sees high risk, so perceived benefits (e.g., clean energy) are minimized.
  - **Application to BSL (implied)**:
    - Strong negative affect toward certain dog breeds → perceived high risk → benefits (companionship, therapy, service functions) are undervalued.
  - **Pitfall**: Treating risk and benefit as independent, when in practice people’s emotions push them to see them as inversely related.
