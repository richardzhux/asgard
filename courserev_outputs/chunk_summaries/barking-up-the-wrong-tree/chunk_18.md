# Chunk 18 (units 13941-14840)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Use of Debunked “Evidence” to Justify BSL**
    - Courts have relied on now-discredited claims about pit bulls, such as:
      - “Pit bull bites to kill without signal.”
      - Pit bulls possessing a unique “kill instinct,” “savageness,” and “unpredictability.”
      - Jaw-strength myth: pit bulls’ jaws allegedly exert 2,000 psi, “three times” that of German Shepherds or Dobermans, and “strongest of any animal per pound.”
    - Modern research (e.g., National Canine Research Council) has debunked these claims.

  - **Rational Basis Review and BSL**
    - Constitutional **standard** applied: usually **rational basis** (very deferential to government).
    - Government’s claimed **legitimate interest**: preventing dog bites / protecting public safety.
    - Author’s argument: BSL fails even rational basis because:
      - **Breed does not predict propensity to bite**, so restrictions by breed are not rationally related to the stated safety goal.
    - Note: Some scholars urge a **more demanding standard** than rational basis for BSL, but the article doesn’t take a firm position on that; it argues BSL fails even the lowest standard.

  - **Vagueness Challenges to BSL**
    - **Core vagueness issue**: whether people of ordinary intelligence have fair notice of what is prohibited (e.g., knowing whether their dog is a banned “pit bull” / “pit bull-type”).
    - **Courts upholding BSL (finding no vagueness)**:
      - Rely on assumptions that:
        - Vets and typical dog owners can determine a dog’s breed or “phenotype.”
        - “Commonly available knowledge of dog breeds” is sufficient to identify pit bulls.
      - Examples: Dog Fanciers (Colorado), Tellings II (Ohio), Des Moines (Iowa, partially).
    - **Courts finding BSL vague**:
      - Language covering “types” or **mixed breeds** can be too subjective.
      - Example concerns:
        - Ordinances forcing owners to “guess” what “look” is prohibited.
        - Determinations depending on unnamed persons and “unknown standards.”
      - Examples: City of Lynn (Massachusetts), Des Moines (Iowa – regarding “dogs of mixed breed”).

  - **Unexamined Assumption About Breed Identification**
    - Underlying assumption in many decisions: **owners know what breed their dog is**.
    - Evidence suggests this is often **incorrect**, especially for mixed breeds and “types.”
    - Courts generally **avoid** exploring this factual question because:
      - If owners cannot reliably know the breed, the entire BSL scheme risks being unconstitutional (no fair notice).

  - **Current Picture of BSL Targets (U.S. & Abroad)**
    - As of 2014, **pit bulls** are the main focus of BSL.
    - Other frequently targeted breeds:
      - Rottweilers
      - Cane Corsos
      - Presa Canario
      - Various mastiffs
      - Chow chows
      - Akitas
    - Some courts, like in **Hardwick v. Town of Ceredo**, repeat generalized claims that pit bulls:
      - Are “aggressive by nature,”
      - Have “strong massive heads and jaws,”
      - Represent a “public health hazard,” and
      - Have a propensity to “attack without provocation.”

- **Definitions / key terms**

  - **BSL (Breed-Specific Legislation)**: Laws that regulate or ban ownership of particular dog breeds (or “types”) deemed dangerous.
  - **Rational basis review**: Lowest level of constitutional scrutiny; law is upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.
  - **Vagueness doctrine**: A law is unconstitutionally vague if people of ordinary intelligence cannot determine what is prohibited, or if it invites arbitrary enforcement.

- **Examples**

  - **Mythical pit bull traits cited by courts**:
    - “Kill instinct” not shared by other dog breeds.
    - “Savageness and unpredictability.”
    - Exaggerated jaw strength claims (2,000 psi, strongest of any animal per pound).
  - **Vagueness examples**:
    - Ordinance language like “pit bull-type dogs” and “dogs of mixed breed” leading to subjective, appearance-based enforcement.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **Confusing correlation with causation**:
    - Assuming higher media coverage of pit bull incidents proves the breed is inherently more dangerous; the article emphasizes that **breed alone doesn’t predict biting behavior**.
  - **Overconfidence in visual breed identification**:
    - Courts often assume owners and officials can reliably identify breed or “type” by appearance; research suggests this is frequently **wrong**, especially for mixed breeds.
  - **Assuming myths are facts**:
    - Jaw-strength and “kill instinct” claims have been widely repeated in legal opinions but are **scientifically unsupported**.
  - **Thinking vagueness is the only constitutional issue**:
    - While vagueness challenges sometimes succeed, the article stresses that BSL should also fail **rational basis** because the policy tool (breed) doesn’t match the goal (reducing bites).
