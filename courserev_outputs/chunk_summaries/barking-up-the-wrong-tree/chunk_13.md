# Chunk 13 (units 9841-10740)

Key concepts / sections
- State-level preemption of BSL and related rules  
- Federal / military breed-specific regulations  
- Presidential (Obama) opposition to BSL vs. continuing military policy  
- Court challenges, especially the role of *Sentell v. New Orleans & Carrollton R.R.*  

Definitions / core ideas
- **Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**: Laws that regulate or ban dogs based solely on breed (e.g., pit bulls, Rottweilers), rather than on individual behavior.
- **Preemption (state vs. local)**: When a state statute blocks (abrogates) local ordinances on the same topic. Here, states can:
  - Forbid local BSL
  - Sometimes also forbid *any* local “dangerous dog” ordinances
  - Sometimes forbid insurance discrimination based on dog breed.
- **Qualified property interest in dogs** (*Sentell*, 1897): Dog ownership is property, but:
  - The owner’s right is “qualified” (not absolute).
  - The government’s **police power** over dogs is “broad and plenary,” giving wide latitude to regulate, restrict, or even destroy dogs for public safety.

Key statutory example
- **Pennsylvania statute (3 PA. CONS. STAT. § 459-507-A)**:
  - (c) Local ordinances on dangerous dogs are abrogated.
  - Local ordinances “may not prohibit or otherwise limit a specific breed of dog.”
  - (d) Insurance policies may not exclude coverage based on breed.  

Federal / military regulations
- **U.S. Army & Marine Corps BSL (2009)**:
  - Applies to all bases and privatized base housing.
  - Bans: pit bull–type dogs, Rottweilers, Doberman pinschers, chow chows, wolf hybrids, “other dogs prone to aggression or dominance,” and exotic pets.
  - Justified on public health, safety, and welfare grounds.
- **U.S. Air Force (2012)**:
  - Adopts a similar standardized pet policy banning certain breeds in base housing.
- **Practical impact on military families**:
  - Families with banned breeds may:
    - Be unable to live on-base.
    - Struggle to find off-base housing because many landlords/insurers also restrict breeds.
  - Example: blog account of family forced to re-home their dog Willa, experienced as a serious emotional “sacrifice” tied directly to BSL.

Federal policy stance vs. practice
- **President Obama’s 2013 statement against BSL**:
  - “We don’t support breed-specific legislation… bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources.”
  - Cites **CDC 2000 study**:
    - Fatal attacks are a very small fraction of dog-bite injuries.
    - “Virtually impossible” to calculate reliable bite rates by specific breed.
- **Tension**:
  - Despite this policy stance and research, military BSL rules **remain in force**, with no signs of repeal.

Court challenges to BSL
- Numerous challenges over the last ~30 years, with mixed results.
- **Major obstacle: *Sentell v. New Orleans & Carrollton R.R.* (1897)**:
  - Treats dogs as a special category of property.
  - Strongly affirms government authority to regulate dogs for public safety.
  - This precedent makes constitutional challenges to BSL and other dog-control laws harder to win.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- **Assuming Obama’s statement changed the law**: It was a policy position, not binding legislation; military BSL stayed in place.
- **Equating bans on local BSL with broad animal protection**:
  - Some state statutes only forbid breed-specific rules but may still allow strict “dangerous dog” laws based on behavior.
  - Others (like Pennsylvania’s) go further and also block local dangerous-dog ordinances and insurance breed discrimination; don’t assume all preemption laws are this broad.
- **Thinking dogs have the same property protection as other goods**:
  - Because of *Sentell*, courts often give governments more leeway to regulate or restrict dogs than other forms of property.
