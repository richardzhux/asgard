# Chunk 39 (units 31161-32060)

Key concepts / sections
- Role of the Media in Risk Perception
- Media-driven “panics” and low-probability risks
- Heuristics: availability, affect, representativeness
- Long-term changes in social risk perception (e.g., dog breeds)
- Biases, predispositions, and information “cascading”

Definitions / key ideas
- **Availability heuristic**: People judge how likely something is based on how easily examples come to mind (e.g., vivid news stories of rare events).
- **Affect heuristic**: Emotions (fear, anger, sympathy) strongly influence risk judgments, often more than statistics.
- **Representativeness heuristic**: 
  - People estimate probability based on how much something matches a stereotype, not on actual base rates.
  - Example: “Steve” is described as shy, withdrawn, bookish, helpful → people rate it “highly probable” he is a librarian, ignoring that librarians are rare.
- **Probability neglect**: When strong emotions are involved, people focus on how bad an outcome would be and ignore how unlikely it is.
- **24-hour news cycle**: A highly competitive, profit-driven media environment that prioritizes emotionally charged, attention-grabbing stories.

Examples
- Media-fueled panics cited by Sunstein and Gardner:
  - Anthrax attacks (2001)
  - “Summer of the shark”
  - Internet pedophiles (early 2000s)
  - Satanic cults (1990s)
  - Child abductions (1980s)
- Dog-bite legislation:
  - Prince George’s County “vicious animal” report: breed-specific laws are costly and ineffective.
  - Example cost estimate: about **$68,000** to confiscate and euthanize one dog labeled a “pit bull,” with no measurable safety gain.
- Language shift:
  - “Pit bull” now also means “an aggressive or tenacious person,” showing how media and culture reshape the term and associated risk perception.

Main arguments
- Media outlets choose **emotionally evocative** stories to attract attention and profit, which:
  - Over-represent rare, dramatic risks.
  - Trigger availability, affect, and representativeness heuristics.
  - Promote probability neglect (people worry more about televised rare events than mundane, likely dangers).
- Over time, repeated coverage:
  - Produces **long-lasting shifts** in how society views certain risks.
  - Example: pit bulls, Rottweilers, etc., are now deeply stereotyped as “vicious/dangerous” in U.S. public consciousness, making reversal very difficult.
- Individuals interpret media through **preexisting biases**:
  - Gun-control advocates notice/remember stories of guns used in crimes.
  - Second Amendment advocates notice/remember stories where guns prevent crimes.
  - This selective attention memorably reinforces existing beliefs (“confirmation bias” in practice).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing **frequency of media coverage** with **actual frequency** of events; vivid coverage ≠ common occurrence.
- Assuming stereotypes (e.g., “pit bulls are inherently dangerous,” “Steve seems like a librarian so he probably is one”) reflect true probabilities; they often ignore base rates.
- Thinking media simply “inform” instead of also **shaping** risk perception through story selection and framing.
- Ignoring how **personal bias** filters what we notice and recall, leading us to think “the evidence” strongly supports our view when we’ve actually been selectively attending to consistent examples.
