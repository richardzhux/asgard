Key concepts / sections
- Status of Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)
- International trends and repeals of BSL
- Science behind canine aggression
- Empirical evaluations of BSL (Australia, Spain, Germany, Netherlands)

Definitions
- Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL): Laws that restrict, regulate, or ban ownership of certain dog breeds (often “pit bulls,” Rottweilers, wolf hybrids, etc.) based on breed or appearance, rather than individual behavior.
- Breed-neutral law: Regulation that targets dangerous or irresponsible behavior (of owners/dogs) regardless of breed.

Key points & examples

1. Status of BSL in the U.S.
- No U.S. state currently has an enforceable, *statewide* BSL:
  - Ohio previously labeled “a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog” as per se “vicious,” but repealed this in 2012 (HB 14).
- BSL remains mostly a local (city/county) issue:
  - 31 states allow local jurisdictions to enact BSL with no restriction.
  - 19 states *preempt* local BSL (i.e., forbid municipalities from passing breed-specific rules).
- U.S. military bases have their own BSL-type restrictions on pit bulls, Rottweilers, wolf hybrids, and other breeds.

2. International BSL and repeals
- Countries/regions with national or regional BSL:
  - UK: Dangerous Dogs Act (national-level BSL).
  - Spain: National forms of BSL.
  - Australia: Example of provincial BSL in Victoria.
  - Canada: Winnipeg, Manitoba has BSL.
- Countries that repealed BSL:
  - Netherlands: Scrapped pit bull ban after finding no effect on dog attack rates.
  - Italy:
    - At one time restricted or banned 92 dog breeds, later reduced to 17.
    - Eventually repealed BSL in favor of breed‑neutral dog bite prevention laws.

3. Science behind canine aggression
- Courts’ recognition:
  - Ohio Court of Appeals (Toledo v. Tellings) noted that scientific evidence does *not* support the idea that certain breeds are inherently “dangerous” as a group.
- Research findings:
  - Canine aggression is complex and multi-factorial, not determined solely by breed.
  - Risk factors other than breed are more predictive of aggression (e.g., environment, training, management, owner behavior).
- Empirical evaluations of BSL (non-U.S.):
  - Multiple studies (Australian, Spanish, German, Dutch) from 2006–2009 examined whether BSL reduced dog bites or attacks.
  - Despite differing data and methods, all concluded:
    - BSL is *not* an effective means of curbing canine aggression.
    - These findings contributed to some nations repealing BSL in favor of breed‑neutral approaches.

4. Australian study (Collier, 2006)
- Published in the *Journal of Veterinary Behavior*.
- Method:
  - Examined dog bite data in several Australian regions.
  - Compared pre‑BSL vs. post‑BSL statistics.
- Purpose:
  - To determine whether BSL had any measurable effect on dog bite incidents.
- Core finding (as described here):
  - Did *not* find support for BSL as an effective tool for reducing dog aggression.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing *breed* with *behavior*: Research emphasizes that breed alone is a poor predictor of aggression; many other variables matter.
- Assuming BSL is widespread at the state/national level in the U.S.: In reality, it is mostly local; only one state (Ohio) had statewide BSL, and that was repealed.
- Believing that countries keep BSL because it “works”: Some nations (Netherlands, Italy) explicitly repealed BSL after data showed no impact on dog attack rates.
