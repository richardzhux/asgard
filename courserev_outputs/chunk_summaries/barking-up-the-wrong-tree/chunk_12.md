# Chunk 12 (units 9021-9920)

**Key concepts / sections**

- **State vs. Local Authority on Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**
  - Most states: no statewide BSL, but allow **municipalities** to enact their own BSL.
  - A growing group of states: **preempt** local BSL (ban cities/counties from regulating by breed).

- **Ohio as a Case Study**
  - **1987 statute**: defined any dog “commonly known as a pit bull dog” as a **“vicious dog”** by law.
    - Effect: ownership of a pit bull = *prima facie* evidence of owning a vicious dog.
    - Functioned like **strict liability** for owners for damage caused by pit bulls.
  - **2012 repeal**:
    - Returned to a **breed‑neutral** definition of “vicious dog.”
    - Did **not** invalidate **local** BSL; many Ohio cities still have pit bull bans/restrictions.
      - Example: Lakewood, OH: bans pit bulls and canary dogs.
      - Example: Parma, OH: bans pit bulls and wolf hybrids; grouped with wild/exotic animals like lions, tigers, bears, etc.
  - Net effect: Ohio moved back into the national mainstream: **no statewide BSL, but local BSL allowed.**

- **State Preemption of Local BSL**
  - **Preemption laws**: state statutes that **forbid local governments** from regulating dogs based on breed.
  - **California**:
    - First to preempt BSL (1989).
    - Still allows **breed-specific spay/neuter** rules.
  - As of ~2014: **18 states** have some form of BSL preemption.
    - Some **grandfather** existing local BSL enacted before the state ban.
    - Some limit only **“dangerous dog”** breed laws; others cover **all** breed-based rules or even **insurance** practices.

- **Examples of Variation Among States**
  - **South Dakota (2014)**:
    - Prohibits any local “ordinance, policy, resolution, or other enactment” that is specific to the **breed or perceived breed** of a dog.
  - **Pennsylvania**:
    - Preempts local BSL.
    - Also restricts **insurance regulation** based on dog breed (goes beyond just dangerous-dog ordinances).
  - Other preemption states (details not all given here) include: CA, CO (with home-rule exceptions like Denver), CT, FL (grandfathering earlier BSL), IL (home rule carve‑out), ME, MA, MN, NV, NJ, NY, OK, PA, etc.

**Key definitions**

- **Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**: Laws that single out particular dog breeds (e.g., pit bulls) for bans or special restrictions (muzzling, insurance, registration, confinement rules).
- **Vicious dog (Ohio, repealed definition)**: 
  - A dog that, without provocation:
    - (i) Killed or caused serious injury to a person;
    - (ii) Caused non-serious injury to a person or killed another dog;
    - (iii) Belonged to a breed “commonly known as a pit bull dog.”
  - Ownership of such a breed = prima facie evidence of owning a vicious dog.

- **Preemption (in this context)**:
  - A state law that **blocks** local governments from enacting conflicting or stricter laws on a given subject (here, breed-based dog regulations).

**Examples**

- **Local BSL despite breed-neutral state law**:
  - Ohio after 2012: state law is breed-neutral, but:
    - Lakewood: pit bull and canary dog ban.
    - Parma: bans pit bulls and wolf hybrids alongside wild animals.

- **States with partial vs. broad preemption**:
  - Partial: California allows breed-specific spay/neuter rules.
  - Broad: South Dakota bans *any* local enactment targeting breed or “perceived breed.”

---

**Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

- **“Ohio repealed BSL, so pit bulls are allowed everywhere in Ohio now.”**
  - Misleading: the state **repealed statewide BSL**, but **cities can and do still ban or restrict** certain breeds.

- **“Preemption means no BSL at all in the state.”**
  - Not always:
    - Preemption usually means **no local** BSL, but the **state itself** could still adopt breed-based rules.
    - Some preemption statutes are **narrow** (only dangerous-dog statutes) vs. **broad** (all breed-based rules and insurance).

- **Uniformity assumption**
  - Each state’s preemption law is **different** in scope (dangerous-dog laws only vs. any breed-based law vs. insurance regulation), so you cannot generalize across states without reading the specific statute.
