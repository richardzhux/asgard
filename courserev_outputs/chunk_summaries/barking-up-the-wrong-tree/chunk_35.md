Key concepts / sections
- Media, fear, and misperception of risk
- Dangerous dogs and breed-specific legislation (BSL)
- Availability heuristic in public risk perception
- Example case: Diane Whipple dog attack
- Comparative mortality risk (dogs vs other causes)

Definitions / concepts
- Availability heuristic:
  - A cognitive shortcut where people judge how likely something is based on how easily examples come to mind.
  - Strong, vivid, recent, and heavily reported events feel more common than they actually are.
- Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL):
  - Laws that regulate or ban specific dog breeds (e.g., pit bulls), often justified on grounds of public safety.

Key points and examples
- Ebola vs flu:
  - Ebola in the U.S.:
    - Only a few cases; transmission requires contact with bodily fluids; not contagious until symptoms appear.
    - CDC stated 99.99% of Americans were at essentially no risk.
    - Despite this, there was nationwide panic (e.g., school district in Ohio closed because an administrator may have been on the same plane—not same flight—as a nurse who later showed symptoms).
    - Some states imposed mandatory quarantines for travelers from West Africa; businesses restricted employee travel.
  - Flu and pneumonia:
    - In 2013, over 56,000 Americans died from influenza and/or pneumonia.
    - These are common and familiar, so they do not evoke comparable fear or media panic.
  - Illustration: People fear the rare, salient threat (Ebola) more than the common, deadlier threats (flu/pneumonia).

- Media coverage of dog attacks:
  - Dog attack fatalities are extremely rare.
    - Economist estimate: annual chance an American dies from “contact with a dog” is < 1 in 11 million.
    - This is:
      - Lower than death by lightning (~1 in 10 million).
      - Far lower than death by firearm (~1 in 500,000), falling down stairs (~1 in 157,000), or choking (~1 in 100,000).
  - Despite rarity, dog attacks—especially involving alleged “pit bulls”—get intense, vivid media coverage.
  - This “unbridled” coverage magnifies fear and distorts perceived risk, feeding support for BSL.

- Case study: Diane Whipple
  - 2001 attack in San Francisco:
    - Victim: healthy adult, killed in her apartment building hallway.
    - Dogs: two large dogs (not pit bulls) being cared for by a neighbor.
    - Attack described as especially savage; drew extensive national and international media coverage.
  - The case:
    - Is still one of the most cited dog-attack fatality examples in legal discussions of BSL.
    - Shows how a single shocking event can anchor public fear and policy debates.

- Availability heuristic and BSL:
  - Extensive, emotionally charged reporting of dog attacks:
    - Makes such incidents “available” in memory, so people overestimate their frequency and likelihood.
    - Identification of dogs as “pit bulls” tends to increase coverage and public fear, even when the breed label may be incorrect.
  - Cass Sunstein’s point:
    - The availability heuristic is culturally and context dependent: what is “available” to one community (due to recent local incidents or media focus) may not be “available” to another.
    - Thus, communities with recent dog attacks or intense media coverage may be more likely to adopt BSL.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing salience with frequency:
  - Just because an event is dramatic and widely reported (Ebola, dog mauling) does not mean it is common or likely to affect an individual.
- Misattributing causation to breed:
  - Media tendency to label dogs as “pit bulls” can:
    - Be inaccurate.
    - Feed the perception that pit bulls are uniquely dangerous, regardless of data on overall risk and breed misidentification.
- Ignoring baseline risks:
  - People often overlook far more common and deadlier risks (flu, pneumonia, accidents) that lack sensational coverage.
- Assuming the availability heuristic is uniform:
  - It varies by community and culture; local experiences and media shape what comes readily to mind and thus what people fear.
