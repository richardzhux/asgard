Key concepts / sections
- Dog Bite-Related Fatalities (DBRFs) and risk factors
- “Resident” vs “family” dogs
- Owner behavior and husbandry factors
- Breed identification reliability
- Multifactorial nature of severe aggression
- Survey data on everyday canine aggression
- Emerging work on canine brain chemistry and genetics

Definitions
- DBRF: Dog Bite-Related Fatality.
- Resident dog: Dog generally isolated from positive human interaction (tethered/ penned outdoors, or sequestered in basement/garage/other area; not integrated into family life).
- Family dog: Dog kept in the home with regular, positive interactions with the family.
- Mismanagement: Allowing a dog to be a danger (e.g., knowingly letting a dangerous dog run loose).
- Abuse: Severe negative treatment (e.g., beating, dogfighting, sexual abuse, other harsh physical punishment).
- Neglect: Failing to provide adequate food, water, shelter/shade, or needed medical care.

Key findings (DBRF study)
- Sex/neuter status:
  - Very few DBRF incidents clearly involved only neutered males (7%).
  - Spayed females were involved in less than 1% of 256 incidents.
  - Many cases lacked clear data on sex/neuter status.
  - Authors theorize intact males may incite other dogs in multi-dog attacks.
- Breed:
  - Eye-witness breed identification was unreliable enough to “cast doubt” on breed data without DNA/pedigree.
- Husbandry and environment:
  - 37.5%: Evidence of owner mismanagement.
  - 21.1%: Evidence of prior abuse or severe neglect (likely underreported).
  - 76.2% of dogs involved were “resident” dogs, not “family” dogs.
  - 74.2% of deaths occurred on the owner’s property.
  - 87.1% of incidents occurred when the owner was not present.
- Multifactor causation:
  - In >80% of DBRFs, at least 4 risk factors were present.
  - In >60%, at least 5 risk factors were present.
  - Pattern: neglect, mismanagement, isolation, abuse + a vulnerable victim → DBRF.
  - Implication: DBRFs are rare but often preventable via responsible ownership, not breed-specific legislation (BSL).

Survey studies on general canine aggression
- Show “substantial within-breed variation” in aggression → breed alone is a weak predictor; environment/development are important.
- Risk factors for increased aggression:
  - Physical punishment.
  - Unneutered male dogs.
  - Older dogs.
  - Dogs with younger owners.
  - Dogs with female owners (association noted; mechanism unclear).
- Factors associated with decreased aggression:
  - Younger dogs.
  - Spayed female dogs.
  - Dogs with older owners.
  - Puppies that attended training classes.
- Takeaway: Aggression does not occur in a “breed vacuum”; needs a multi-factor, breed-neutral approach.

Emerging area: brain chemistry & genetics
- Recent (2010, 2013) studies show some shared brain chemistry traits in certain aggressive dogs.
- The work is early and narrow; suggests biological contributions but not a simple “aggression gene” story.

Examples
- “Resident dog” example: a dog chained in a yard with little to no positive interaction, or locked in a basement most of the time.
- “Family dog” example: a dog living inside, regularly handled, trained, and engaged by the family.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Overemphasis on breed:
  - Media and policy often blame specific breeds, but:
    - Breed ID in incidents is often unreliable.
    - There is large within-breed variation.
    - Multiple non-breed factors co-occur in most fatal cases.
- Thinking a single factor “causes” DBRFs:
  - Data show most DBRFs involve a cluster of risk factors, not one isolated mistake.
- Ignoring husbandry:
  - Isolation, neglect, and abuse are central risk factors but get less media attention than breed.
- Misreading correlations:
  - Associations (e.g., with owner age or owner sex) do not prove causation and may reflect confounding variables (training style, supervision, etc.).
