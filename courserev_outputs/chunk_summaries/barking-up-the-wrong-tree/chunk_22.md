# Chunk 22 (units 17221-18120)

Key concepts / sections
- German behavior evaluation of “dangerous” breeds (Schalke et al.)
- Follow-up golden retriever control study (Ott et al.)
- Policy impact: repeal of BSL in Lower Saxony
- Start of Dutch government-commissioned evaluation of BSL

Definitions / methods
- BSL (Breed-Specific Legislation): Laws that restrict or ban ownership of particular dog breeds deemed “dangerous” (e.g., pit bull types, Rottweilers, Dobermans).
- Behavior evaluation / temperament test:
  - Dog–owner teams observed in 21 everyday scenarios involving:
    - Strangers (friendly, threatening, unusual appearance, abrupt movements)
    - Child-like situations
    - Common stimuli (bicycles, umbrellas, joggers)
    - (Dog–dog interactions evaluated but not reported here; focus was aggression toward people.)
- Aggression scoring system (1–7):
  - 1: No aggression at all
  - 2–7: Increasingly escalated aggression
    - 2: Only visual/auditory signals while staying still or backing away
    - 3–4: Bite movements but no contact (still, backing away, or stopping short)
    - 5: Threatening behavior followed by an actual completed bite/attack
    - 6: Bite/attack without prior threatening behavior
    - 7: Most extreme aggression (not reached by any dog in the study)

Key results & examples
German “dangerous breeds” study (415 dogs: pit bull types, AmStaffs, bull terriers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, Staffordshire bull terriers):
- 158 dogs (≈38%): score 1 (no aggression at all, in any scenario).
- 201 dogs (≈48%): score 2 (only visual/auditory threat while remaining still or backing away).
- 18 dogs (≈4%): scores 3–4 (bite movements but no contact).
- 37 dogs (≈9%): score 5 (threat + completed bite/attack).
- 1 dog (<1%): score 6 (attack without prior threat).
- No dogs: score 7 (highest aggression).
- Of the 37 dogs at level 5, only 19 showed aggression in **inappropriate** situations.
- Overall: 95% of all dogs reacted appropriately across all scenarios.
- Crucial finding: **no significant difference between breeds** on inappropriate aggression.
- Conclusion: breed-based risk classification **not justified** on this data.

Golden retriever follow-up (70 dogs):
- >98% reacted appropriately to all situations (vs. 95% in first study).
- 1.43% showed inappropriate aggression (vs. 5% in first study).
- No statistically significant difference between:
  - Golden retrievers (control group) and
  - Breeds targeted by BSL in first study.
- Policy impact: Lower Saxony repealed its BSL after these publications.

Additional note
- Prior research warns that owning a non-designated “safe” breed (e.g., German shepherd) may create a **false sense of security** about bite risk.

Dutch study (intro)
- First known **government-commissioned** scientific evaluation of BSL (Netherlands, completed 2009).
- Three surveys:
  - Survey 1: >40,000 households; identified 1,420 individuals bitten by a dog in last 24 months.
  - Survey 2: Follow-up with those bitten, to collect details about the dog–victim interaction.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming “dangerous” breeds are inherently more aggressive toward people:
  - Empirical testing found **no significant breed difference** in inappropriate aggression.
- Assuming BSL improves safety:
  - These studies undercut the basic premise that targeting certain breeds is evidence-based.
- Equating any aggressive display with unjustified dangerous behavior:
  - Many aggressive signals occurred when dogs were physically threatened or faced abrupt movements—contexts where defensive reactions are expected. Only a subset were **inappropriate**.
