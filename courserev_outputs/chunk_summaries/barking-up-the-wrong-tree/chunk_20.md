Key concepts / sections
- Evaluation of Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)
- 2006 Australian study (Collier)
- Concept of Population Attributable Fraction Percentage (PAF%)
- Data/reporting flaws in dog-bite statistics
- Intro to 2007 Spanish study on “Dangerous Animals Act” (DAA)

Definitions / formulas
- Population Attributable Fraction Percentage (PAF%):
  - Measures what percentage of the *overall* dog population a particular breed represents.
  - Simple example: 100 dogs total, 10 identified as American Pit Bull Terriers (APBT) → PAF% for APBT = 10%.
  - Used to compare bite reports per breed against that breed’s share of the dog population.

Key findings & arguments – Australian study (Collier)
- Collier compared:
  - Pre-BSL vs. post-BSL dog-bite statistics in several Australian regions.
  - Bite reports per breed against that breed’s PAF%.
- Methodological flaws in PAF%-based “dangerousness”:
  - Registration bias:
    - PAF% is calculated mainly from *registered* dogs; governments then extrapolate to estimate total population.
    - This assumes all breeds have similar registered/unregistered ratios.
    - In reality, owners of restricted breeds (e.g., APBT) are more reluctant to register them → undercounting of those breeds.
  - Effect of underestimating a breed’s PAF%:
    - If a breed’s population is undercounted, the same number of bites is spread over a smaller “official” population.
    - This artificially inflates that breed’s apparent bite rate/aggressiveness.
  - Unreliable breed identification in bite incidents:
    - Breed is often identified by eyewitnesses or media reports, which are not reliable sources of data.
- Substantive conclusions:
  - Aggressive dogs constitute only a very small proportion of any breed (up to ~1% at most).
  - BSL in Australia has not reduced the number of dog bites.
  - Targeting specific breeds with the worst bite records is unlikely to have a lasting effect:
    - Many different breeds can be made dangerous through irresponsible ownership.

Spanish study – setup
- 2007 Spanish study (Rosado et al., Journal of Veterinary Behavior):
  - Evaluated Spain’s “Dangerous Animals Act” (DAA).
  - The DAA combines:
    - Breed-specific elements (list of “dangerous” breeds, including various “pit bull–type” and similar breeds).
    - Breed-neutral provisions.
  - Study reviews dog-bite data from the 5 years immediately before enactment of the DAA (details continue in next chunk).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Misinterpreting bite statistics:
  - Treating raw bite counts by breed as objective indicators of inherent breed “dangerousness,” without adjusting for:
    - True population size of the breed (including unregistered dogs),
    - Misidentification of breed in incidents.
- Assuming BSL is effective:
  - Empirical work (including the Australian study) finds *no* meaningful reduction in dog-bite incidents after BSL.
- Overgeneralizing from rare cases:
  - High-profile incidents can create myths about entire breeds, but data suggest only a very small fraction of any breed is aggressive.
