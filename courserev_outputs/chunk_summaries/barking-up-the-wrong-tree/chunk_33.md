# Chunk 33 (units 26241-27140)

Key concepts / sections
- Prospect Theory & Behavioral Decision Theory
- Heuristics in judgment and decision-making
- Neuroscience basis of emotion vs rationality
- Dual-process (System 1 / System 2) model of thinking
- Application to law/policy (e.g., fear-based legislation like BSL)

Definitions
- Prospect Theory:  
  A theory (Kahneman & Tversky) explaining how people actually make decisions under risk, showing systematic departures from rational, expected-utility calculations.

- Heuristic:  
  A simple mental “shortcut” or procedure that helps generate quick, often adequate but sometimes imperfect answers to difficult questions.

- System 1 (dual-process model):  
  Fast, automatic, intuitive, largely unconscious thinking. Uses heuristics heavily; good for quick, survival-related decisions.

- System 2 (dual-process model):  
  Slow, deliberative, effortful, and more “rational” thinking. Engages in higher-order, step-by-step reasoning when time and cognitive resources are available.

Neuroscience details
- Amygdala:
  - Brain structure linked to emotional responses.
  - Heavily involved in forming and storing emotional memories, especially of highly emotional events.
  - Supports rapid “fight or flight” style responses by quickly recalling past emotional experiences.

- Neocortex:
  - Supports higher-order, analytic, and what we usually call “rational” thinking.
  - Used when we have time to weigh risks, costs, and benefits more carefully.

Applications / Examples
- Policy decisions:
  - Behavioral and cognitive science have been applied to economics, law, and public policy to explain how societies actually make decisions.
  - Many laws and policies are shaped more by emotional fear responses and distorted risk perceptions than by rational calculation.
  - Example noted: Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL) is described as a law driven by fear rather than reasoned risk assessment.

- Heuristics mentioned (to be discussed further later in the text):
  - Availability heuristic: judging frequency or risk by how easily examples come to mind.
  - Affect heuristic: using emotional reactions (like fear, dislike, or sympathy) as a shortcut for judgment.

Key insights / takeaways
- Traditional view overturned:  
  Earlier belief: humans are mostly rational; emotions occasionally disrupt this.  
  Behavioral research: humans systematically make predictable errors in judgment; emotions and heuristics are central, not exceptional.

- Systems don’t always “activate” appropriately:
  - System 1 can dominate even when System 2 would be more appropriate (e.g., complex policy choices).
  - This mismatch leads to systematic judgment errors, especially in risk assessment and public policy.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Heuristics = bad”:
  - Heuristics are not inherently irrational or harmful; they are efficient and often useful.
  - The problem arises when the context requires careful analysis, but we still rely on fast heuristics.

- “Emotion vs rationality as separate”:  
  - The text emphasizes they are intertwined via brain structures (e.g., emotional memory strongly influences what System 1 “retrieves” and how it reacts).
  - Emotional memories can be adaptive (survival) but can misfire in complex, modern policy issues.

- “Policy is always rational”:  
  - Law and policy are often assumed to be the product of deliberation (System 2), but research shows they are frequently driven by fear-based, System 1 responses and misperceived risk.
