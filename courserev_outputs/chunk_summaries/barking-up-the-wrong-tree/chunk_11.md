Key concepts / sections
- Local-level Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)
- Typical restrictions and requirements
- De facto breed bans (practical impacts)
- State-level BSL, focusing on Ohio

Definitions / core ideas
- Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL): Laws that regulate or prohibit ownership of specific dog breeds (often pit bulls, but sometimes others) based on the assumption that the breed is inherently dangerous.

Local BSL: typical measures
- Restrictions can include:
  - Mandatory registration of certain breeds.
  - Prohibition on transfer, sale, or breeding within the jurisdiction.
  - Special insurance requirements (liability coverage).
  - Additional permits or licensing.
  - Confinement and control rules (e.g., leash, muzzle, secure enclosure).

Detailed example: Akron, Ohio ordinance (very restrictive BSL)
For pit bulls, Canary Dogs, American Bulldogs, and “vicious dogs,” owners must:
1. Identification:
   - Dog must wear a fluorescent green collar at all times (city-issued for a fee).
   - Dog must be tattooed with a city-provided code.
   - Two color photos required; another photo after tattooing.
2. Warning sign:
   - City-issued sign (for a fee) posted conspicuously on premises.
   - Must be visible/readable from public street/highway.
3. Reporting:
   - Notify city within 24 hours if the dog dies, is sold, or donated.
   - Provide new owner’s contact information.
4. Confinement/control:
   - Keep dog:
     - Inside home, OR
     - In locked enclosure with top and concrete base, fencing anchored 6 inches into concrete, OR
     - Muzzled, on a chain-link leash ≤ 6 feet, held by a responsible person when outside.
   - Ensure dog is never “unconfined” on another’s property or “at large” in city.
5. Insurance:
   - Liability insurance of at least $50,000 per occurrence for injury/death caused by the dog.
   - Proof of insurance required at registration and collar issuance.
6. Registration & licensing:
   - Annual registration with city (specific January dates) and upon obtaining the dog.
   - Annual county dog license (if > 3 months old); failure to wear license tag = prima facie evidence of no license.
7. Vaccination:
   - Rabies vaccination at least once every 3 years by licensed vet.
   - Rabies tag must be worn at all times; absence = prima facie evidence of no vaccination.

Examples of local BSL elsewhere
- Arkadelphia, Arkansas: Pit bulls must be registered, cannot be transferred within city limits, and cannot be bred; insurance required.
- Prince George’s County, Maryland: Prohibits keeping any pit bull.
- Many localities: Combine registration, insurance, permits, confinement rules, and transfer/breeding restrictions.

De facto breed bans
- Even where a breed is not formally “banned,” strict BSL can operate as a practical ban because:
  - Owners cannot obtain or afford homeowners’ insurance.
  - Owners cannot find rental housing that accepts the breed.
  - Owners fear increased personal liability.
- Result: People are effectively prevented from owning these breeds.

Dynamic nature of local BSL
- Local BSL is in flux:
  - New ordinances are passed.
  - Existing ordinances are repealed due to:
    - Ineffectiveness,
    - High enforcement costs,
    - Advocacy by canine/animal welfare groups.
- At any time, hundreds of U.S. jurisdictions employ some form of BSL.

State laws: focus on Ohio
- General pattern: Most states leave BSL decisions to local governments.
- Ohio as an exception:
  - 1987 statute defined a pit bull as a “vicious dog” by law, irrespective of the dog’s individual behavior.
  - Legal consequence: Ownership of a pit bull created an automatic presumption of dangerousness.
  - Liability effect: Owners were effectively strictly liable for harm caused by their pit bulls.

Common pitfalls / confusions
- Confusing “ban” vs. “restriction”:
  - Not all BSL is a complete prohibition; many are layers of burdensome conditions.
  - However, heavy restrictions can function as a de facto ban.
- Assuming BSL is uniform:
  - Requirements vary widely by jurisdiction (collars, tattoos, insurance, enclosures, etc.).
- Misunderstanding “vicious dog” under law:
  - In Ohio’s statute, “vicious” was a legal classification attached to the breed itself, not a finding based on individual behavior or incident history.
