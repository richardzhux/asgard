- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Early U.S. Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**
    - 1983: First pit bull ban (e.g., in Cincinnati) after a child killed by parents’ dogs.
    - 1984: Tijeras, New Mexico bans pit bulls after severe attack on a 9‑year‑old.
    - 1985: ~30 U.S. communities considering some form of pit bull restriction.
    - 1987 (July): Ohio statutorily classifies pit bulls as per se “vicious dogs” and restricts ownership.

  - **Media-Driven Moral Panic**
    - Late 1980s: National media runs sensational stories with fear‑inducing titles:
      - “Boy and His Dog in Hell” (Rolling Stone)
      - “An Instinct for the Kill” (People)
      - “Beware of This Dog” (Sports Illustrated)
      - “Time Bombs on Legs” (Time)
    - Stories included sensationalism and pseudoscience, contributing to exaggerated fears and urban legends about pit bulls.

  - **Spread of BSL to Major Cities and Abroad**
    - 1989: BSL adopted in Miami‑Dade County (FL) and Denver (CO).
    - 1990: Winnipeg, Manitoba (Canada) adopts BSL (still in effect under current “Responsible Pet Ownership” by‑law).
    - 1991: United Kingdom enacts the Dangerous Dogs Act with BSL.
    - 1990s onward: Many other jurisdictions worldwide (e.g., Victoria, Australia; Spain, etc.) pass BSL.

  - **What “Pit Bull” or “Pit Bull‑Type” Means in Law/Policy**
    - Commonly includes several breeds:
      - American Pit Bull Terrier
      - American Staffordshire Terrier
      - Staffordshire Bull Terrier
      - Bull Terrier
    - Often also includes:
      - Any mix containing these breeds.
      - Any dog that “substantially looks like” one of these breeds (appearance‑based).

  - **Expansion of BSL Beyond Pit Bulls**
    - Over time, many more breeds have been added in various localities, such as:
      - Rottweilers
      - Akitas
      - Bullmastiffs, Mastiffs
      - Presa Canarios
      - Cane Corsos
      - “Any dog” specified by local ordinance (open‑ended lists).

  - **Cycle of Breed Bias**
    - Negative media attention → Pit bulls acquire a “vicious” image.
    - That image attracts “substandard” or irresponsible owners who want a tough‑looking/status dog.
    - Poor ownership and training → real behavior problems → more attacks → more negative media and broader BSL.
    - This cycle is described as stronger for pit bulls than for most other breeds.

- **Definitions**

  - **Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL):** Laws and ordinances that regulate or ban ownership of specific dog breeds (or types) perceived as dangerous, rather than addressing individual dog behavior or owner conduct.
  - **“Pit bull” / “Pit bull‑type” (in BSL context):** A legal/policy category, not a single breed, encompassing several related breeds and often any dog resembling them.

- **Examples**

  - Local BSL examples: Cincinnati (1983), Tijeras (1984), Miami‑Dade and Denver (1989).
  - National BSL examples: UK Dangerous Dogs Act 1991; Victoria, Australia’s Domestic Animals Act.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

  - **Myths about pit bulls**
    - “Locking jaw” myth: Claim that pit bulls have a special jaw mechanism that locks—no credible evidence; they simply have strong bites like many large dogs.
    - “Impervious to pain” myth: Exaggerated; they can be tenacious but are not pain‑proof or “super‑predators.”
  - **Misidentification issues**
    - BSL often applies based on appearance or mix status, leading to:
      - Dogs of unknown or mixed ancestry being labeled “pit bulls” incorrectly.
      - Arbitrary or inconsistent enforcement.
  - **Assuming BSL targets only pit bulls**
    - In practice, once BSL emerges, lists often broaden over time to many large or stigmatized breeds, sometimes at the discretion of local officials.
