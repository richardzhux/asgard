# Chunk 24 (units 18861-19760)

Key concepts / sections
- Analogy: Buckbeak in Harry Potter as a stand‑in for real dogs
- Critique of breed-specific legislation (BSL) and breed focus
- 2013 comprehensive study of dog bite-related fatalities (DBRFs)
- Victim-related risk factors
- Dog-related risk factors (especially sexual status)
- Rarity and statistics of fatal dog attacks

Definitions / formulas
- Dog Bite-Related Fatality (DBRF):  
  A human death caused by a dog bite; study examined 256 DBRFs in the U.S. over 10 years.

- Victim “no relationship” with dog:  
  Visitor, intruder, or passerby with no prior bond to the dog.

- Victim “incidental relationship” with dog:  
  Person other than owner/primary caretaker who is regularly present at the home but does not regularly interact with the dog in positive and humane ways.

- DBRF rates from the study (U.S.):  
  - 256 DBRFs over 10 years → mean 25.6 incidents/year  
  - Human population ≈ 295.5 million; dog population ≈ 68.8 million  
  - Rate per year:
    - 0.087 fatal incidents per 1,000,000 people  
    - 0.38 fatal incidents per 1,000,000 dogs  
  → DBRFs are extremely rare.

Key findings / concepts
- Media & statistics problems
  - Dog bite statistics are often unreliable (e.g., media-based counts, poor data quality).
  - Overemphasis on “breed” has detracted from tackling more important, controllable factors (ownership, husbandry, environment).

- 2013 DBRF study methodology
  - Used primary sources (law enforcement, animal control, veterinarians, prosecutors, dog owners, witnesses), not just media.
  - Allowed more detailed, accurate case information.

- Ownership & husbandry over breed
  - Study concludes that focusing on breed obscures:
    - Ownership practices
    - Dog husbandry and environment
    - Complex, non-simple genetic influences on behavior  
  → “When we focus on breed, we miss the real dangers.”

Victim-related risk factors
- Relationship to the dog:
  - 85% of victims had:
    - No relationship with the dog: 74.2%
    - Only incidental relationship: 10.9%

- Victim vulnerability:
  - Over half of victims were:
    - Under age 5: 45.3%, or
    - Impaired in their ability to interact properly with dogs (10.6%), due to:
      - Drug or alcohol use
      - Dementia
      - Alzheimer’s disease
      - Uncontrolled seizure disorders

- Lack of supervision:
  - 87.1% of incidents occurred with no able-bodied adult present to intervene.

Dog-related risk factors
- Sexual status:
  - In 82.2% of incidents (212 cases), only sexually intact (not neutered/spayed) dogs were involved.
  - Another 4 incidents involved both intact and altered dogs.
  - Authors suggest intact dogs may have incited other dogs in multi-dog attacks.

Examples
- Fictional: Buckbeak (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban)
  - Hippogriff attacks a boy who ignored clear warning signals and approached aggressively.
  - Animal is blamed and sentenced to death despite human error.
  - Used as an analogy for real-world dog incidents where human misbehavior or misunderstanding leads to the animal being punished, often with euthanasia.

- Policy example: Netherlands
  - Study (Cornelissen & Hopster) contributed to abolition of breed-specific legislation (BSL).
  - Agriculture Minister cited that the breed ban did not reduce biting incidents.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Mistaking breed for primary risk factor:
  - Policy and public discourse often overvalue breed, underestimating:
    - Supervision
    - Victim vulnerability
    - Dog’s sexual status
    - Quality of ownership and care.

- Overreacting to extremely rare events:
  - DBRFs are statistically very rare; policy built as if they are common misallocates resources.

- Trusting media-based statistics:
  - Media reports can misidentify breeds and miss context; they’re not a reliable basis for law or policy.

- Ignoring human responsibility:
  - Focusing on “dangerous dogs” can obscure how human behavior (poor supervision, bad handling, failure to neuter, unsafe environments) creates risk.
