# Chunk 46 (units 36901-37340)

- **Key Concepts / Sections**
  - **Pit bull terminology and stigma**
  - **Shelter naming practices (American Shelter Dog)**
  - **Conclusion: actual risk of dog bites vs public fear**
  - **Policy implication: rational dog laws vs fear-based laws**

- **Definitions / Core Ideas**
  - **“Pit bull” as a label, not a true breed**
    - There is **no single, actual “pit bull” breed**; it’s an umbrella term applied to multiple types/mixes.
    - The term has accumulated strong **negative connotations** in the public lexicon, making it hard to rehabilitate.
  - **American Shelter Dog**
    - Proposed neutral label for mixed-breed or shelter dogs that **avoids breed-based stigma**.
    - Some shelters/advocates even suggest **dropping breed labels altogether** and calling all shelter dogs “American Shelter Dogs.”
  - **Dog bite risk**
    - Estimated ~**4.7 million dog bites/year** in the U.S., but:
      - No mandatory reporting → **statistic is uncertain/questionable**.
      - Many bites are **very minor and don’t need medical care**.
    - Estimated **77+ million dogs** in U.S. households.
    - Given the dog population, **serious or fatal dog attacks are rare** → indicates a strong, generally safe human–dog relationship.

- **Examples**
  - Historical rebranding: “Siberian” and “Cuban bloodhounds” disappeared as terms, which helped **erase prior breed bias**—used as an analogy for dropping “pit bull.”
  - Modern practice: Shelters using **“American Shelter Dog”** to avoid misidentification and stigma.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**
  - **Thinking “pit bull” is a specific, clearly defined breed**
    - Legislation and shelter policies often treat “pit bull” as if it were a precise category, but it’s **vague and inconsistently applied**.
  - **Assuming humans can accurately identify dog breeds by sight**
    - Research shows even **shelter staff are poor at visual breed identification**, undercutting breed-based rules and labels.
  - **Overestimating the danger of dog bites**
    - High bite-number estimates can sound alarming, but:
      - Most bites are **minor**.
      - **Serious injury is statistically rare** compared to the number of dogs.
    - This mismatch between **perceived risk** and **actual risk** fuels **irrational fear and unjust, fear-based laws**, especially breed-specific bans.

- **Main Conclusion**
  - Law and policy should:
    - **Address the real but relatively small risk** of severe dog bites.
    - **Avoid irrational, fear-driven responses** (particularly breed-specific legislation).
    - Recognize and protect the long-standing **positive human–canine relationship** rather than undermining it through stigma.
