# Chunk 14 (units 10661-11560)

Key concepts / sections
- Sentell v. New Orleans & Carrollton R.R. (1897) and its legacy  
- Police power over dogs and property status of dogs  
- Types of laws affecting dogs (including BSL)  
- Constitutional challenges to BSL  
- Rational basis review and “rational basis with bite”  
- Vagueness challenges to BSL  

Definitions / doctrines
- **Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**: Laws that regulate or ban ownership of particular dog breeds (e.g., pit bulls) rather than dangerous behavior generally.
- **Police power (re dogs)**: Government’s broad authority to regulate dogs for public health, safety, and welfare (e.g., licensing, leash laws, dangerous dog laws).
- **Qualified property interest in dogs** (from Sentell): Owners have property rights in dogs, but those rights are limited/“qualified” because of dogs’ potential risks; allows extensive regulation and even destruction without full traditional property protections.
- **Rational basis test** (substantive due process / equal protection): Law is upheld if:
  1. There is a **legitimate government interest** (e.g., public safety), and  
  2. The law is **rationally related** to that interest.  
  No heightened scrutiny if no suspect class, quasi-suspect class, or fundamental right is involved.
- **Void for vagueness** (due process): A law is unconstitutional if people of ordinary intelligence must guess at its meaning or if it invites arbitrary enforcement (relevant to unclear breed definitions).
- **“Rational basis plus” / “rational basis with bite”**: A more searching form of rational basis review; court scrutinizes whether the purported rational basis is actually supported by evidence, not just hypothesized.

Key cases / examples
- **Sentell v. New Orleans & C.R. Co., 166 U.S. 698 (1897)**  
  - Recognizes dogs’ value as companions but emphasizes their “wolfish instincts” and risk.  
  - Holds that strong regulation is permissible; basis for later upholding wide dog-control measures.
- Laws enabled by Sentell (examples):  
  - **License requirements** and **registration** (City of Dickinson v. Thress)  
  - **Leash laws** / prohibitions on dogs running at large (Thiele v. City of Denver)  
  - **Mandatory spay/neuter** (Concerned Dog Owners of Cal. v. City of L.A.)  
  - **Dangerous dog laws** and **BSL** (e.g., pit bull bans)
- **Vanater v. Village of S. Point (S.D. Ohio 1989)**: Upheld pit bull ban as valid under police power, expressly relying on Sentell.
- **Colorado Dog Fanciers v. City of Denver (Colo. 1991)**: Rejected substantive due process and equal protection challenges to Denver’s pit bull ban under rational basis.
- **Garcia v. Village of Tijeras (N.M. Ct. App. 1988)**: Rejected procedural/substantive due process and vagueness challenges to a pit bull ban.
- **American Dog Owners Ass’n v. City of Lynn (Mass. 1989)**: Example of **successful vagueness challenge** under state law; portions of local BSL struck down.

Main outcomes / trends
- **Sentell’s effect**:  
  - Gives “carte blanche” (very broad discretion) to state/local lawmakers to restrict dog ownership/property rights.  
  - Frequently cited to uphold BSL and other dog regulations.
- **Constitutional challenges to BSL**:  
  - Usually brought under federal and state constitutions (14th Amendment due process & equal protection, plus state analogues).  
  - Courts typically apply **deferential rational basis review**, finding public safety a legitimate interest and BSL rationally related to it.  
  - Result: **most substantive due process and equal protection challenges fail**.
- **Where challenges have had some success**:  
  - **Vagueness** claims, particularly under **state** constitutional/case law, where the state has strong precedent on clarity requirements (e.g., Massachusetts in Lynn).

Scholarly critique / evolving argument
- Kristen Swann, “Irrationality Unleashed: The Pitfalls of Breed-Specific Legislation”:
  - Argues courts should use **“rational basis plus”** for BSL because:
    - Emerging science shows **no reliable link** between breed and aggression.
    - As empirical support erodes, the “rational basis” for BSL disappears.
  - Implication: If courts seriously examine the evidence, many BSLs could fail even under a more demanding rational basis review.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- **Confusing property rights with strong constitutional protection**:  
  - Dogs are property, but **only a qualified property interest**; this does not trigger strict or intermediate scrutiny. Regulation can be very intrusive.
- **Assuming 14th Amendment claims are strong in BSL cases**:  
  - In practice, federal due process and equal protection arguments **rarely succeed**; success more often comes from **state-level** vagueness doctrines.
- **Overlooking the standard of review**:  
  - The key battle is often over **what level of scrutiny applies**. As long as courts stick to ordinary rational basis, BSL is usually upheld.
- **Misunderstanding vagueness**:  
  - Not all unclear or scientifically questionable BSL is “vague” in the legal sense.  
  - Vagueness focuses on **clarity of terms and guidance to enforcers**, not whether the policy is scientifically sound.
