# Chunk 29 (units 22961-23860)

Key concepts / sections
- Unreliability of eyewitness identification
- Extension of that concern to visual identification of dog breeds
- Role of DNA evidence in exposing and correcting misidentifications
- Implications for breed-specific legislation (BSL) and enforcement
- Canine genome mapping and DNA breed tests

Definitions / main ideas
- Eyewitness identification (criminal law):
  - Identification of a suspect by a witness based on memory and perception.
  - Widely recognized as highly unreliable:
    - Susceptible to suggestion
    - Strong impact on juries
    - Resistant to normal adversarial testing
- Expert testimony on eyewitness ID:
  - Many jurisdictions now permit experts to explain the limits of human perception and memory.
  - 45/50 states + most federal jurisdictions allow such testimony at trial courts’ discretion.
  - Only Kansas and Louisiana categorically bar expert testimony on eyewitness ID.

Key findings / evidence
- Human eyewitness misidentification:
  - Leading cause of wrongful convictions overturned through DNA evidence.
  - Innocence Project: involved in ~70% of such cases.
- Courts’ response:
  - DNA exonerations have “forced” courts to rethink how they treat eyewitness testimony.
  - Recognition that human memory is limited, fallible, and perception is inexact.

- Parallel to canine/breed identification:
  - Visual identification of dog breeds is not more reliable than visual ID of human suspects.
  - DNA evidence similarly shows many visual breed identifications are wrong.
- Voith et al. (2013) study:
  - 923 participants, all working in dog-related fields (veterinarians, shelter staff, AKC show judges).
  - Found extremely low accuracy in visual breed identification.
  - Undermines:
    - The factual basis of breed-specific laws (which assume reliable breed ID).
    - The possibility of rational or just enforcement of those laws if based on sight alone.

- Canine genome and DNA tests:
  - Dog genome mapped (Lindblad-Toh et al. 2005), enabling genetic breed identification.
  - Commercial tests (e.g., Wisdom Panel) claim to identify >200 breeds.
  - Scholars argue:
    - Given unreliability of visual ID, canine DNA should be regularly admitted for breed identification, especially where legal consequences attach (e.g., BSL).

Examples
- DNA evidence freeing wrongfully convicted humans whose convictions rested on mistaken eyewitness IDs.
- Canine DNA tests revealing that dogs labeled as a certain “dangerous” breed (often under BSL) are actually different or mixed breeds.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming:
  - Experts (vets, shelter workers, show judges) can reliably identify breed by sight:
    - Empirical data shows they are often wrong.
  - Dog-breed identification is easier/more reliable than human suspect ID:
    - The article argues there is no reason to think so; evidence suggests similar or worse problems.
- Legal confusion:
  - Treating visually identified breed as “fact” in enforcement of breed-specific laws without genetic confirmation, despite known unreliability.
  - Ignoring that, as with human eyewitness ID, reliance on visual breed ID can lead to unjust outcomes (e.g., euthanasia, restrictions) for wrongly labeled dogs.
