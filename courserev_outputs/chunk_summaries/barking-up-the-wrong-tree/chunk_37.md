- Shift to macro-level: how heuristics affect policy
- Probability neglect

Definitions / core ideas

- Affect heuristic:
  - People rely on their immediate emotional reaction (“affect”) to judge:
    - How beneficial an activity is
    - How risky an activity is
  - Emotion acts as a shortcut in decision-making (“lubricates reason”) but can mislead, especially when emotions are strong or context is manipulated.

- Inverse risk–benefit relationship (Slovic’s nuclear power study):
  - Perceived benefit and perceived risk move in opposite directions:
    - If people are told benefits are high → they infer risks are low.
    - If people are told risks are low → they infer benefits are high.
    - If people are told risks are high → they infer benefits are low.
    - If people are told benefits are low → they infer risks are high.
  - This holds regardless of the person’s starting position.

- Probability neglect (Sunstein):
  - People are poor at intuitively assessing probabilities.
  - When a heuristic and strong emotion are involved, people focus on the feared outcome and:
    - Overestimate likelihood when fear/examples are vivid and available.
    - Underestimate or ignore likelihood when risks are not salient or emotionally engaging.
  - They “neglect” the true probability because the emotional reaction dominates.

Examples

- Tobacco advertising:
  - Cigarette companies used positive, affect-laden imagery (e.g., the “Marlboro Man”: rugged, free, outdoors, blue skies) to:
    - Create a strong feeling of benefit and well-being unrelated to smoking itself.
    - Depress perceptions of the health risks highlighted by Surgeon General warnings.
  - Demonstrates deliberate manipulation of the risk–benefit inverse relationship via affect.

- Pit bull perceptions:
  - Negative affect examples:
    - Time magazine 1987 cover; seeing a pit bull with a drug dealer and spiked collar.
    - Evokes fear and a sense of high risk from pit bull-type dogs.
  - Positive affect examples:
    - Someone who grew up with a pit bull as a loving family dog.
    - Evokes nostalgia, obvious benefits, and perception of very low risk.
  - Once these emotional associations are formed, they are:
    - Long-lasting
    - Resistant to change, even with factual counterevidence.

- Macro-level influence:
  - Heuristics (like affect and availability) shape:
    - Economic behavior
    - Legislation
    - Regulation
    - Public policy
  - Because policymakers and the public share the same cognitive biases, policy can reflect distorted risk perceptions.

Pitfalls / common confusions

- Thinking “I’m rational so I’m not affected”:
  - Even researchers and informed readers are subject to the affect heuristic; it operates automatically in System 1.
  - It cannot be eliminated; only partially tempered by self-awareness.

- Confusing actual risk with felt risk:
  - Strong positive emotion can make a truly risky activity feel safe (e.g., smoking).
  - Strong negative emotion can make a relatively low-probability risk feel highly likely (e.g., rare dog attacks).

- Assuming more information always fixes bias:
  - Additional information that has emotional punch can reinforce the inverse risk–benefit effect.
  - Simply presenting statistics without engaging or correcting the emotional reaction may not change perceptions.
