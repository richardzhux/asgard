# Chunk 30 (units 23781-24680)

Key Concepts / Sections
- **Breed Identification Methods**
  - Visual identification by:
    - Animal control officers / enforcers.
    - Shelter workers.
    - Veterinarians and other “expert” witnesses.
    - Owners’ own breed labels.
  - Genetic (DNA) testing:
    - Wisdom Panel (Mars Veterinary) can identify 200+ breeds.
    - Registration with organizations like AKC/UKC in rare, clearer cases.

- **Voith Study on Visual Breed Identification**
  - Participants: 923 people involved in dog-related professions/activities (assumed dog-knowledgeable).
  - Task: Watch 1-minute color video clips of 20 mixed-breed dogs and visually identify predominant breed(s).
  - DNA benchmark: Each dog’s actual breed makeup determined by DNA (Wisdom Panel).

Definitions / Key Results
- **Over-inclusion (in BSL enforcement)**  
  Dogs incorrectly classified as a banned breed when they do not have that breed in their genetic makeup.
- **Under-inclusion (in BSL enforcement)**  
  Dogs that do have the banned breed in their genetic makeup but are not identified/enforced against because they do not “look” like that breed.

Voith Study Findings
- For 14 of 20 dogs, **fewer than 50%** of respondents identified **any** breed that matched the DNA results.
- Participants agreed on a predominant breed for only **7 of 20** dogs.
  - Of those 7, the agreed-upon predominant breed was **wrong in 3 cases** (not in the DNA profile at all).
- Only **4 of 20** dogs had a predominant breed correctly and consistently identified by **>50%** of participants.
- Conclusion: Even experienced dog people are highly unreliable at visual breed identification.

Examples (from text)
- In a community with a pit bull ban:
  - **Over-inclusion**: Many dogs with no pit bull-type ancestry visually labeled as “pit bull” or “pit bull mix.”
  - **Under-inclusion**: Dogs with pit bull-type ancestry but not pit bull-looking are not targeted.
- Testimony from Toledo v. Tellings:
  - Dog Warden Tom Skeldon stated he focused on the **“look”** of the dog, not actual breed:
    - A dog 50% pit bull that doesn’t look like a pit bull: owner not charged.
    - A dog that looks like a pit bull may be treated as such regardless of exact lineage.

Pitfalls / Common Confusions
- **Assuming professionals can reliably ID breed by sight**:
  - The Voith study shows even knowledgeable professionals often misidentify or disagree.
- **Equating appearance with genetic breed**:
  - “Pit bull-type” look does not reliably track DNA heritage; BSL based on appearance does not truly regulate specific genetic breeds.
- **Assuming BSL can be justly enforced without DNA**:
  - Without mandatory DNA testing of all dogs:
    - Just enforcement by actual breed is practically impossible.
    - Laws will inherently be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive.
- **Goal confusion in BSL**:
  - If the goal is to regulate a **breed** → needs DNA testing (impractical, costly, invasive).
  - If the goal is to regulate a **“look”** (appearance) → then the law is not truly “breed-specific” and may be arbitrary/discriminatory.
