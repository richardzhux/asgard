# Chunk 15 (units 11481-12380)

Key concepts / sections
- Heightened rational basis scrutiny for BSL
- Vagueness challenges to breed-specific ordinances
- Case study: Toledo v. Tellings (Ohio)
- Statutory definition of “vicious dog” (OH Rev. Code § 955.11, repealed 2012)
- Evolving scientific evidence vs. earlier “myth-based” cases

Definitions / doctrines
- Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL): Laws that target particular dog breeds (e.g., “pit bulls”) as inherently dangerous, often imposing bans, limits, or special conditions (insurance, confinement, etc.).
- “Rational basis plus” / “rational basis with a bite”:
  - A more searching form of rational basis review.
  - Court still nominally uses rational basis, but actually probes whether the asserted government interest and the means chosen have some real evidentiary support, not just fear or stereotypes.
- Vagueness (Due Process):
  - A law is unconstitutionally vague if:
    - It fails to give ordinary people fair notice of what is prohibited, and/or
    - It encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by giving excessive discretion to officials.

Key statutory definition (Ohio, repealed 2012)
- “Vicious dog” under OHIO REV. CODE § 955.11(A)(1):
  - A dog that (without provocation):
    1. Has killed or caused serious injury to any person; or
    2. Has caused other injury to a person, or has killed another dog; or
    3. “Belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog.”
  - Ownership/keeping/harboring a pit bull = prima facie evidence of owning/keeping/harboring a “vicious dog.”
  - Note: (3) makes pit bulls per se vicious based solely on breed.

Vagueness issues in BSL
- City of Lynn (Mass. 1989):
  - Problem: Ordinance banned “pit bull” “types” and mixed-breeds.
  - Court’s concerns:
    - Enforcement depends on subjective understanding of what a “pit bull” looks like.
    - Owners must guess at what “look” or “type” is prohibited.
    - Proof of a dog’s “type” can be impossible, especially if not registered.
    - Gives “unleashed discretion” to dog officers → risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
- Des Moines case:
  - Portion of BSL restricting mixed and non-specific breeds held unconstitutionally vague due to unacceptable risk of arbitrary/discriminatory application.
- Contrast: American Dog Owners Ass’n v. City of Yakima (Wash. 1989):
  - BSL upheld where:
    - Four specific breeds were listed, and
    - Ordinance provided adequate identification standards, limiting discretion.

Case example: Toledo v. Tellings
- Facts:
  - Owner had three “pit bull-type” dogs in Toledo, Ohio.
  - Citations:
    - Violations of municipal ordinance limiting households to one pit bull.
    - Violations for not having liability insurance required when harboring a “vicious dog” (under § 955.11, which defines pit bulls as per se vicious).
  - Dogs observed during a lead-based paint inspection → reported to dog warden.
  - Owner then:
    - Gave one dog away,
    - Was allowed to keep one,
    - One dog confiscated and destroyed.
  - Owner challenged constitutionality of state statute and ordinance on substantive and procedural due process grounds, among others.
- Trial court:
  - Held five days of testimony from at least 16 experts (12 for owner, 4 for state).
  - Found:
    - Pit bulls “are not, as a breed, more dangerous than other breeds,” but
    - Statutes/ordinance still constitutional because pit bulls “present a problem in the urban setting.”
  - Rationale:
    - Pit bulls used extensively for dog fighting and by “criminal elements” (drug dealers, gang members).
    - Concentrated in urban areas with crowding and many children.
- Court of Appeals (Tellings I):
  - Reversed trial court.
  - Held no rational basis for distinguishing pit bulls from other dogs.
  - Recognized:
    - Earlier BSL-upholding cases rested on “unsubstantiated myths” and sensationalized media hype.
    - Scientific research had since undermined those assumptions.
  - Concluded that the per se vicious designation in the statute was unconstitutional (based in part on admission of evidence showing no special breed danger).

Role of science
- As empirical research shows no inherent link between breed (esp. pit bulls) and aggression:
  - The factual predicate for BSL’s “rational basis” weakens or “evaporates.”
  - Supports calls for:
    - “Rational basis with a bite” review.
    - Courts refusing to rely on old precedents (e.g., Sentell) grounded in fear/stereotypes rather than data.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing “pit bull-type” with a clear, objective category:
  - Many ordinances use ill-defined “types,” leading to vagueness problems and arbitrary enforcement.
- Assuming rational basis review = automatic government win:
  - Authors argue that when evidence contradicts legislative assumptions, rational basis should still have “bite.”
- Equating high incidence of pit bulls in criminal/urban contexts with inherent dangerousness:
  - Evidence may show correlation driven by human use (e.g., dog fighting, status dogs), not breed biology.
- Overlooking that “per se vicious” labels can shift the proof burden:
  - Prima facie presumption against owners on breed alone, even without any incident involving the specific dog.
