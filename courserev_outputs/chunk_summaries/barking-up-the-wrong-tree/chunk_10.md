# Chunk 10 (units 7381-8280)

Key concepts / sections
- Global spread of Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)
- Social drivers of pit bull–type dog popularity and stigma
- Types of breed-specific laws in the U.S.
- Local ordinances as the primary BSL tool

Definitions / core ideas
- Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL): Laws that regulate or ban dogs based on breed or appearance (e.g., “pit bull–type” dogs), rather than on individual behavior.
- “Pit bull”: Often defined broadly to include multiple “bull and terrier” breeds and mixes, and sometimes any dog that resembles these breeds.

Key points
- Worldwide examples of BSL:
  - Victoria, Australia (Domestic Animals Act 1994): Prohibited five “restricted breeds,” including pit bulls.
  - Spain (Spanish Dangerous Animals Act of 1999): Targeted a list of eight breeds/breed types.
  - Lower Saxony, Germany (GefTVO 2000): Banned pit bulls and heavily restricted large breeds (Rottweilers, Dobermans, mastiffs, etc.).
  - Italy: Once restricted 92 breeds; later repealed BSL in favor of breed‑neutral measures.

- U.S. context:
  - Local ordinances are the most common BSL form.
  - Cincinnati, Ohio (1983) often cited as modern birthplace of BSL.
  - Ohio state‑level BSL followed in 1987.
  - By 1989, major cities (e.g., Denver, Miami‑Dade County) had pit bull bans.
  - Lawmakers often relied on highly publicized attacks (local or elsewhere) to justify BSL and sometimes ignored expert testimony.

- Social dynamics & media effects:
  - Media portrayal of pit bulls in fighting, guarding, criminal contexts increased their appeal to “status symbol” owners and unsuitable owners.
  - High‑profile fatal attacks (e.g., Diane Whipple killed by Presa Canarios in 2001) created spikes in popularity of those breeds as “killer dogs.”
  - Increased population of these dogs in irresponsible hands + poor breeding controls likely:
    - Increased actual bite incidents.
    - Increased labeling of any biting dog as a “pit bull” (identification bias).

- Structure of local BSL ordinances (types of rules):
  - Registration and breeding restrictions:
    - Example: Arkadelphia, Arkansas – pit bulls must be registered, cannot be bred or transferred within city limits.
  - Complete bans on ownership/keeping:
    - Example: Prince George’s County, Maryland – prohibits keeping any pit bull.
    - Denver, Colorado; Miami‑Dade County, Florida – pit bull bans enacted in 1989.
  - Ownership conditions and restrictions:
    - Mandatory muzzling and leashing in public for certain breeds.
    - Specific fencing requirements (height, materials).
    - Tattooing or other identification requirements for regulated dogs.

Examples mentioned
- Countries: Australia (Victoria), Spain, Germany (Lower Saxony), Italy.
- U.S. jurisdictions: Cincinnati & State of Ohio; Denver, CO; Miami‑Dade County, FL; Arkadelphia, AR; Prince George’s County, MD.
- Breed surge example: Presa Canarios after the Diane Whipple case.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Pit bull” is not a single, standardized breed:
  - It is a loose category (“type”), covering multiple breeds and mixes, making regulation and data collection inconsistent.
  - Breed organizations have less control over breeding/sale compared to single recognized breeds.
- Identification bias:
  - As pit bulls become socially salient, more dogs involved in incidents are *reported* as pit bulls, even if they are not, inflating apparent risk.
- Causation vs correlation:
  - Increases in pit bull bites may be driven by:
    - More pit bull–type dogs owned.
    - Concentration of these dogs among irresponsible owners.
    - Media and reporting biases.
  - Not necessarily by any inherent dangerousness of the breed.
