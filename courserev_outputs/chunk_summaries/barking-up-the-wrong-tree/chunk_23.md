# Chunk 23 (units 18041-18940)

Key concepts / sections
- Dutch government dog-bite study & Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)
- Bite Risk Index and breed distribution
- Limits of BSL as a prevention tool
- Recommended multi-factor prevention strategies
- Epidemiological view: dog bites are complex, not mainly breed-driven
- Example illustrating unsafe child–animal interactions (Harry Potter)

Definitions / formulas
- Bite Risk Index:
  - Defined as:  
    **(fraction of a breed among biting dogs) ÷ (fraction of that breed in the total dog population)**  
  - An “average” dog/breed has an index of **1**.
  - >1 = overrepresented in bite incidents relative to population  
    <1 = underrepresented.

Study design and main empirical findings
- Surveys:
  1. Injury surveillance: identified dog-bite victims over 24 months.
  2. Victim survey: details of dog–victim interaction and breed of biting dog (with photos to aid ID).
  3. Dog-owner survey (>10,000 owners): breed and registration status.
- Key statistics:
  - ~33% of victims bitten by **their own dogs**.
  - 62% of all bites, and **75% of bites to children**, occurred in **non-public places** (e.g., homes, private property).
  - 31% of bites were “unintentional” (during play or accidental).
  - 80% of bites caused **no injury or only minor injury** (32% no injury; 48% minor injuries).
  - 92% of respondents gave a breed identification.
  - **86 different breeds** were identified as having bitten someone.

Breed-specific findings
- Breeds with bite risk index **above 1** (higher relative bite risk):
  - Belgian shepherds, Jack Russell terriers, German shepherds, Dobermans, etc.
- Breeds with bite risk index **below 1** (lower relative bite risk):
  - Golden retrievers, Yorkshire terriers, mixed breeds.
- Core conclusion:
  - Many breeds bite: **86 different breeds** identified.
  - Eliminating one, a few, or even twenty breeds **does not eliminate risk**.
  - Removing all “high-bite” breeds would mean removing many common breeds—“neither practicable nor desirable.”

Policy implications & critique of BSL
- The study’s breadth underscores the **complexity** of dog-bite risks.
- Researchers’ conclusion:
  - “All dogs can bite”; attack records or breed alone are not a sound basis for policy.
  - Findings **do not support** using attack records to build mitigation strategies.
- Netherlands’ policy shift:
  - After this inquiry, the Netherlands **repealed BSL**.
  - Moved toward **prevention efforts** targeted to actual bite-risk patterns (where, who, circumstances), not just breed.

Recommended prevention strategies
- Tailor strategies to context and relationship:
  - Bites to **children**:
    - Most occur at home by dogs the child knows.
    - Solutions:
      - Educate children on safe dog interaction and respecting animal space.
      - Warn parents about dangers of leaving children and dogs unsupervised.
  - Bites to **owners** vs **strangers**:
    - Different dynamics and triggers; require distinct prevention approaches.
- Emphasis: multi-pronged, situational prevention > breed bans.

Example in text
- Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban:
  - Harry approaches Buckbeak (hippogriff) respectfully, notes body language → positive interaction.
  - Draco Malfoy approaches aggressively, ignores warning signals → gets injured; the animal is punished.
- Used as an analogy:
  - Children often fail to respect animal personal space or read warning signs, leading to injury.
  - Illustrates the need for **education about animal behavior and safe approach**.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming:
  - Banning “dangerous” breeds will meaningfully solve dog-bite problems.
  - Breed attack records alone are a reliable basis for regulation.
  - Most serious bites occur in public by unknown “vicious” dogs.
- Misinterpreting the Bite Risk Index:
  - A higher index does **not** mean a breed is inherently “evil” or that banning it will fix the problem, especially when many breeds contribute to bites.
- Overlooking:
  - The importance of environment, owner behavior, child behavior, supervision, and training relative to breed.
