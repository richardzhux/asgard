# Chunk 05 (units 3281-4180)

Key Concepts / Sections

1. **Non-toxic shot requirement (continuation of §20.21(j))**
   - While hunting certain migratory birds, you may NOT possess shot other than:
     - Steel shot
     - Bismuth-tin (97:3, <1% residual lead)
     - Tungsten-iron (40:60, <1% residual lead)
     - Tungsten-polymer (95.5 tungsten : 4.5 Nylon 6 or 11, <1% residual lead)
     - Tungsten-matrix (95.9 tungsten : 4.1 polymer, <1% residual lead)
     - Tin (99.9% tin, <1% residual lead)
     - Tungsten-nickel-iron (50%:35%:15%, <1% residual lead)
     - Any other shot approved as nontoxic by the Director under §20.134.
   - Applies only to taking:
     - Anatidae (ducks, geese including brant, and swans),
     - Coots (Fulica americana),
     - Any species included in an aggregate bag limit during concurrent seasons with the above,
     - In areas designated as **nontoxic shot zones** under §20.108.
   - Special note: Tin shot was explicitly legal as nontoxic for waterfowl and coots for the **2000–2001 season only** (historical detail).

   **Pitfall:**  
   - Confusing where the non-toxic shot rule applies: it is tied to specific species (waterfowl/coots and linked aggregate species) AND specific areas (nontoxic shot zones), not all hunting everywhere.
   - “Possessing” prohibited shot (even if you say you’re not using it) can be a violation while hunting those species in those zones.

2. **§20.22 Closed seasons**
   - Taking migratory game birds is **prohibited during closed seasons**, except as specifically allowed in **part 21** (e.g., certain permits, depredation, scientific collecting).

   **Pitfall:**  
   - Assuming state allowances override federal closed seasons; federal closed season rules still apply.

3. **§20.23 Shooting hours**
   - You may take migratory game birds only **during hours open to shooting** as laid out in **subpart K** (the annual season frameworks).
   - Shooting outside those hours is unlawful even if the date and bag limits are legal.

   **Pitfall:**
   - Confusing state-printed hours vs. federal frameworks; both must align—most states mirror the federal rules, but the controlling standard is subpart K.

4. **§20.24 Daily limit**
   - You may not take in any **single calendar day** more than the:
     - **Daily bag limit**, or
     - **Aggregate daily bag limit**, whichever applies.
   - **Aggregate daily bag limit** = combined limit for multiple related species or across areas, as specified in the season rules.

   **Pitfalls:**
   - Thinking you can restart counting at midnight if you are still in the field (the regulation is per calendar day, but possession/transport rules in other sections also matter).
   - Misunderstanding aggregate limits: you can’t take the full limit in one area and then treat another area’s limit as separate if the rules set an aggregate across them.

5. **§20.25 Wanton waste of migratory game birds**
   - You may not kill or cripple a migratory game bird **without making a reasonable effort** to:
     - Retrieve it, and
     - Retain it in your actual custody,
   - At the place where taken or on the route to one of the following:
     - Your vehicle or main land transport
     - Your home or temporary lodging
     - A migratory bird preservation facility
     - A post office
     - A common carrier facility (e.g., shipping point)

   **Key idea:** Hunters must not waste birds; they must try to recover and keep them.

   **Pitfalls:**
   - Shooting birds and then moving on without trying to recover them.
   - Assuming “I couldn’t find it” is always adequate—must show a **reasonable effort**, not just a token attempt.

6. **§20.26 Emergency closures**
   - The Director may **close or temporarily suspend** any season set under subpart K when:
     1. Continuing the season is found to be an **imminent threat** to:
        - The safety of any endangered or threatened species, or
        - Other migratory bird populations.
     2. **Local public notice** is issued, which can include:
        - Publication in local general-circulation newspapers
        - Posting affected areas
        - Notifying the State wildlife agency
        - Announcements on local radio and TV
   - A **Federal Register notice** must be published at the same time as local notice **when practical**; if not possible due to emergency timing, the Federal Register notice follows as soon as possible.
   - The closure or suspension becomes effective on the date stated in the emergency notice.

   **Pitfalls:**
   - Assuming printed season dates/states’ regs cannot change mid-season—emergency closures can override them.
   - Ignoring local announcements; they can have immediate effect even before you see the Federal Register.
