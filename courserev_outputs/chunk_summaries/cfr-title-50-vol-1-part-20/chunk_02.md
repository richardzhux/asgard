# Chunk 02 (units 821-1720)

**CFR Title 50 Part 20 – Key Points (Chunk 2/18)**  

---

### 1. Relationship to Other Laws

- **National Wildlife Refuge System Act**  
  - Part 20 regulations are **in addition to**, not a substitute for, other refuge laws/regulations.
- **State Laws (20.11(d) intro text)**  
  - States **cannot** relax or override federal restrictions in Part 20.  
  - States **may**:
    - Enact laws **consistent** with federal regulations and international conventions, and  
    - Provide **more protection** (e.g., shorter seasons, lower bag limits).

**Pitfall:** Hunters must comply with **both** federal and state rules; the stricter one controls.

### 2. Definitions – § 20.11

#### (a) Migratory Game Birds

- Birds covered by treaties between the U.S. and foreign countries, **for which open seasons are set in Part 20**, and belong to these families:
  1. **Anatidae** – ducks, geese (including brant), swans  
  2. **Columbidae** – doves, pigeons  
  3. **Gruidae** – cranes  
  4. **Rallidae** – rails, coots, gallinules  
  5. **Scolopacidae** – woodcock, snipe  

- A broader list of migratory birds (not just game birds) is in **50 CFR § 10.13**.

**Common confusion:**  
Not all migratory birds are “migratory game birds” (songbirds, raptors, etc. may be protected but are not game).

---

#### (b) Seasons

1. **Open season**  
   - Days when migratory game birds may lawfully be taken.  
   - Includes **both the first and last day** named in the regulation.

2. **Closed season**  
   - Days when migratory game birds **may not** be taken.

**Pitfall:** Hunting at **12:01 a.m. on the first open day or 11:59 p.m. on the last open day** is still within the open season unless further time limits are specified elsewhere.

---

#### (c) Bag and Possession Limits

1. **Aggregate bag limit**  
   - A condition where **two or more similar species** may be taken together to fill a **single maximum take limit**.  
   - Example structure (not in text, but typical): “Daily limit 6 ducks” which can be a mix of certain duck species within specified sub-limits.

2. **Daily bag limit**  
   - Max number of birds of a **single species or combination of species** one person may take in **one day** during open season in **one specified geographic area**.

3. **Aggregate daily bag limit**  
   - Max number of birds one person may take in **one day** when:
     - Hunting in **more than one** geographic area, and/or  
     - For **more than one species** with a combined limit.
   - **Rule:** The aggregate daily bag limit = **the largest single daily bag limit** that applies in any one area or for any one species hunted that day; it **cannot exceed** that number.

   **Pitfall:** You do **not** add daily limits from multiple states/areas. You are capped by the **highest single** daily limit among them.

4. **Possession limit**  
   - Max number of birds of a **single species or combination of species** one person may **possess** when lawfully taken in the U.S. in **one specified geographic area**.

5. **Aggregate possession limit**  
   - Max number one person may possess when **taking and possession** occur in **more than one** geographic area.  
   - **Rule:** The aggregate possession limit = **the largest single possession limit** applicable to any of the species or areas involved; it **cannot exceed** that largest limit.

   **Pitfall:** As with daily limits, you **do not stack** possession limits from multiple states/areas.

---

#### (d) Personal Abode

- **Personal abode** = a person’s **principal or ordinary home**.  
- Explicitly **not** a personal abode:
  - Hunting clubs, clubhouses  
  - Cabins, tents, trailer houses **used as hunting clubs**  
  - Hotels, motels, rooming houses used on hunting, pleasure, or business trips.

**Why it matters:**  
Many rules about how many birds you can have “in the field,” at a camp, or in transit depend on whether birds are at your **personal abode** or a **temporary location**.

---

#### (e) Migratory Bird Preservation Facility

Includes any entity that, **for hire or in the normal course of operations**, receives or holds migratory game birds **belonging to someone else** for picking, cleaning, freezing, processing, storage, or shipment:

1. Any person at their **residence or business** doing this for hire/consideration.  
2. Any **taxidermist, cold-storage facility, or locker plant** doing this for hire/consideration.  
3. Any **hunting club** doing this in the normal course of operations.

**Pitfall:** A hunting club that stores members’ birds is legally a **preservation facility** and subject to recordkeeping and tagging rules, not just a place to hang birds casually.

---

#### (f) Paraplegic

- Individual with **paralysis of the lower half of the body**, affecting **both legs**, usually from disease or injury to the **spinal cord**.

**Context:**  
Often used for special hunting accommodations (e.g., certain access or method-of-take exceptions).

---

#### (g) Normal Agricultural Planting, Harvesting, or Post-Harvest Manipulation

- Defined briefly here as:
  - Actions to **produce and gather a crop**, or  
  - **Manipulations after harvest and grain removal**,  
  - Conducted per **official recommendations** of State Extension Specialists (Cooperative Extension).

**Common confusion (especially for baiting rules):**  
“Normal agricultural practice” is **not** whatever a landowner chooses to do; it must conform to **official extension recommendations**. Non-normal manipulation can be considered **baiting** under other sections.
