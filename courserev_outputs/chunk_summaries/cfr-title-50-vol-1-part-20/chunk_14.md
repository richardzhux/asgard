# Chunk 14 (units 10661-11560)

**Key Concepts / Sections**

- **Statistical analysis of toxicity study data**
  - Use **appropriate chi-square procedures** for categorical outcomes (e.g., survival).
  - Use **analysis of variance (ANOVA)** or other suitable methods for:
    - Physiological data
    - Tissue contaminant data
  - Factors to include at minimum: **shot type** and **sex** of birds.
  - Compare:
    - Birds **sacrificed** at scheduled times vs.
    - Birds that **died prior to sacrifice**, if sample sizes allow a meaningful comparison.

- **Aquatic toxicity testing (Tier 2 environmental tests)**  
  Aim: Assess whether components of the shot or coating are hazardous to aquatic life, using maximum solubility that still maintains valid controls.

  1. **Daphnid Acute Toxicity Test** – 40 CFR 797.1300  
     - Measures **acute (short-term) toxicity** to Daphnids in **static and flow-through systems**.  
     - Used to assess potential **immediate hazard** of the compounds to aquatic environments.

  2. **Daphnid Chronic Toxicity Test** – 40 CFR 797.1330  
     - Measures **chronic (long-term) toxicity** to Daphnids in **renewal or flow-through systems**.  
     - Used to assess **long-term hazard** of the compounds in aquatic environments.

  3. **Fish Early Life Stage Toxicity Test** – 40 CFR 797.1600  
     - Evaluates effects on **early growth and development** of fish.  
     - Used to assess hazard of the compounds to aquatic environments via sensitive life stages.

- **Regulatory outcomes after Tier 2**

  - **Applicant submits Tier 2 results to the Director.**

  - **If Tier 2 + Tier 1 data are inconclusive** (i.e., they do *not* establish that the shot/coating is safe):  
    - Service **advises applicant to proceed with Tier 3** testing.  
    - A **Notice of Review** is published informing the public that Tier 3 is required for further consideration.

  - **If preliminary determination is that the shot/coating does not pose significant danger**:
    - Director publishes a **proposed rule in the Federal Register**:
      - Intention to **approve** the shot/coating.
      - Why **Tier 3 testing is unnecessary**.
      - Includes:
        - **Chemical composition** of the shot/coating.
        - **Synopsis of Tier 2 findings**.
    - After public comment:
      - If **no scientific/technical basis to deny**:
        - Approval is finalized via **final rule** in the Federal Register.
      - If comments indicate data **do not establish safety**:
        - **Tier 3 testing becomes required**.
        - **Notice of Review** is published.
        - If applicant **does not proceed with Tier 3**:
          - A **denial of approval** is published in the Federal Register.

- **Tier 3 Testing Process**

  - Trigger: **Tier 1 or Tier 2 information is inconclusive**.
  - **Director notifies applicant** to submit a **Tier 3 testing plan** following specified subsections.
  - **30-day review** of the Tier 3 plan by the Director:
    - Director may **decline to approve** the plan (or parts of it) for deficiencies in **timing, format, or content**.
    - Director specifies:
      - Which parts to **disregard**.
      - What **modifications** are needed for approval.

  - **Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Compliance**
    - All Tier 3 procedures should comply with **GLP Standards (40 CFR part 160)**, **except** where they:
      - Conflict with this regulation section, or
      - Conflict with an **approved plan**.
    - Director (or representative) may:
      - **Inspect laboratory facilities**.
      - **Decline to approve** the plan and **stop further consideration** of the candidate shot/coating if facilities are not GLP-compliant.

  - Once the plan is accepted, **Tier 3 testing begins** (details continue in the next chunk).

**Definitions / Clarifications**

- **Daphnid**: Small freshwater crustaceans (e.g., *Daphnia*) used as standard invertebrate test organisms in aquatic toxicology.
- **Acute toxicity**: Adverse effects occurring shortly after a single or short-term exposure.
- **Chronic toxicity**: Adverse effects from repeated or continuous exposure over a significant portion of the organism’s lifespan.
- **Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)**: Quality system regulations for planning, performing,
