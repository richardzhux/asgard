Key concepts / sections

- §20.107 – Tundra swan seasons
  - Provides for **annual hunting regulations** (seasons, limits, shooting hours) for tundra swans in **designated portions of the 48 contiguous States**.
  - Details are set each year in the Federal Register (not fixed in the CFR text).

- §20.108 – Nontoxic shot zones
  - As of Sept. 1, 1991, the following are designated **nontoxic shot zones** for **hunting waterfowl, coots, and certain other species**:
    - The 48 contiguous States, Alaska, Hawaii.
    - Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands.
    - U.S. territorial waters.
  - “Certain other species” = species other than waterfowl or coots that:
    - Are included in **aggregate bag limits**, and
    - Have **concurrent seasons** with waterfowl/coots.
  - Effect: Only **nontoxic shot** may be used for those hunts in these areas (per §20.21(j)).

- §20.109 – Falconry seasons
  - Provides for **annual regulations** under which **falconers** may take permitted migratory game birds.
  - Specific seasons/limits/hours are set annually; CFR text here is only a framework reference.

- §20.110 – Indian reservations and ceded lands
  - Provides for **annual migratory bird hunting regulations** for certain tribes on:
    - **Federal Indian reservations**, **Indian Territory**, and **ceded lands**.
  - Details are established each year by regulation.

- Subpart L – Administrative and Miscellaneous Provisions

  - §20.131 – Extension of seasons
    - If a **State emergency action to prevent forest fires** in a large area has:
      - Shortened the hunting season for a migratory game bird species,
    - And if extending/reopening the season **will not reduce bird abundance beyond what was originally contemplated**, then:
      - The **Secretary may extend or reopen** the season, **upon request** of the State’s chief wildlife agency official.
    - Conditions:
      - Must comply with all other provisions of this subchapter.
      - The **extension length cannot exceed** the number of days lost to the fire-closure.
      - The extension/reopening will be **publicly announced**.

  - §20.132 – Subsistence use in Alaska
    - (a) **Eskimos and Indians in Alaska** may:
      - Take, possess, and transport, **any time and by any means**, the following **for food or skins for clothing**:
        - Auks, auklets, guillemots, murres, puffins and their eggs.
      - **May not sell or offer for sale** birds or eggs taken under this provision.
    - (b) **Any person in Alaska** may:
      - For **subsistence purposes**, take, possess, and transport, **any time and by any means**:
        - Snowy owls and cormorants and their eggs, for food or skins for clothing.
      - **May not sell or offer for sale** these birds or eggs.

  - §20.133 – Hunting regulations for crows
    - (a) Crows may be taken, possessed, transported, exported, or imported **only** as allowed by **State law or regulation issued under this section**.
    - (b) States (except Hawaii) may create crow hunting seasons, but:
      - **Hawaii**: **No crows may be taken**.
      - State regulations may set method of take, bag/possession limits, season dates/duration, and other rules, subject to federal limits:
        1. No hunting crows **from aircraft**.
        2. **Maximum 124 hunting days** per calendar year, per State.
        3. Hunting **not allowed during the peak crow nesting period** in that State.
        4. Allowed methods: **firearms, bow and arrow, and falconry only**.

  - §20.134 – Nontoxic shot (start)
    - Establishes a process for **approval of nontoxic shot types**.
    - Information collection for this process is approved under OMB control number **1018–0067**.
    - Purpose: To allow the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to conduct a **methodical, objective review** to approve or disapprove a shot material’s **nontoxic status**.

Definitions / clarifications

- **Nontoxic shot zones**: Areas where only **approved nontoxic shot** may be used to hunt waterfowl, coots, and some other species (mostly those sharing bag limits/seasons with waterfowl).
- **Peak crow nesting period**: Not precisely defined in CFR text; determined by each State’s biological data and reflected in State regulation.

Examples (implicit)

- If ducks and snipe share an aggregate daily bag and are hunted in the same season, snipe would be a “certain other species” requiring nontoxic shot when hunted under that aggregate bag.

Pitfalls / common confusions

- Nontoxic shot:
  - The **entire U.S. and its territories** (plus territorial waters) are nontoxic shot zones for waterfowl/coots and certain other species—this is not limited to national wildlife refuges.
- Crow hunting:
  - Federal rules **do not directly set** crow seasons; States do, but must stay within:
    - 124-day annual limit.
    - No peak nesting season hunting.
    - No aircraft; only specified methods.
  - **Hawaii** is a complete exception: **no crow take allowed** at all.
- Alaska subsistence:
  - Very broad allowances in **time and method**, but:
    - Strict **no sale** rule.
    - Species-specific: general public may not use the Eskimos/Indians provision for auks, etc.; likewise, Eskimos/Indians do not get special sale rights.
