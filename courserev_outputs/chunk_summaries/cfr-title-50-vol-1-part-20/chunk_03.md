Key definitions
- Normal agricultural planting, harvesting, or post-harvest manipulation:
  - Planting/harvesting done to produce and gather a crop, or manipulation after harvest/removal of grain
  - Must be done according to official recommendations of State Extension Specialists (Cooperative Extension Service, USDA).

- Normal agricultural operation:
  - Any normal planting, harvesting, post-harvest manipulation, or agricultural practice
  - Must be in line with State Extension Specialists’ official recommendations.

- Normal soil stabilization practice:
  - Planting for agricultural soil erosion control or post-mining land reclamation
  - Must follow State Extension Specialists’ official recommendations for agricultural soil erosion control.

- Baited area:
  - Any area where salt, grain, or other feed has been placed/exposed/deposited/distributed/scattered
  - If that material could lure/attract migratory game birds to, on, or over areas where hunters are trying to take them.
  - Remains a baited area for 10 days after complete removal of all bait.

- Baiting:
  - Direct or indirect placing, exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of salt, grain, or other feed
  - When it could lure/attract migratory game birds to, on, or over areas where hunters are attempting to take them.

- Manipulation:
  - Alteration of natural vegetation or agricultural crops by:
    - Mowing, shredding, discing, rolling, chopping, trampling, flattening, burning, herbicide treatments, etc.
  - Excludes: Distributing or scattering grain, seed, or other feed after removal from or storage on the field where grown.

- Natural vegetation:
  - Any non-agricultural, native, or naturalized plant species growing at a site:
    - In response to planting, or
    - From existing seed/propagules.
  - Does not include planted millet.
  - Exception: Planted millet that re-grows on its own in later years (after the year of planting) is considered natural vegetation.

§ 20.20 – Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program (HIP)
- Information collection (OMB):
  - Approved under OMB control number 1018–0015.
  - Purpose: Provide a sampling frame for the national Migratory Bird Harvest Survey.
  - Required from licensed hunters to obtain the benefit of hunting migratory game birds.
  - Burden estimate:
    - ~3,300,000 respondents
    - ~2 minutes per response
    - Total ~112,000 hours annually.

- General requirement for hunters:
  - Each person hunting migratory game birds in any State (except Hawaii) must:
    - Identify themselves as a migratory bird hunter to the State licensing authority.
    - Provide name, address, and date of birth.
    - Carry evidence from the State showing compliance with this requirement (often the HIP validation on license).

- Tribal exemptions:
  - § 20.20(b) requirement does NOT apply to:
    - Tribal members on Federal Indian Reservations.
    - Tribal members hunting on ceded lands.

- State exemptions:
  - § 20.20(b) requirement does NOT apply to:
    - Hunters who are exempt from State-licensing requirements in the State where they are hunting.

- State responsibilities:
  - State licensing authority must ask each licensed migratory bird hunter for prior-year information:
    - Approximate numbers of:
      - Ducks, geese, doves, woodcock bagged.
    - Whether they hunted:
      - Coots, snipe, rails, gallinules.
    - In States with band-tailed pigeon seasons:
      - (text continues beyond this chunk, but implies similar harvest questions).

Examples / clarifications from text
- Natural vegetation and millet:
  - Planted millet in the planting year = NOT natural vegetation.
  - Millet that re-seeds and grows in later years without replanting = natural vegetation.

Common pitfalls / confusions
- Baited area duration:
  - Area is still considered baited for 10 days after ALL bait is completely removed.
- Manipulation vs. baiting:
  - Manipulation covers altering standing crops/vegetation (mowing, discing, etc.).
  - It explicitly does NOT include distributing or scattering grain removed from the field—this can be baiting.
- “Normal” agricultural practices:
  - Must follow official State Extension recommendations; personal or local “common practice” alone may not qualify.
- Natural vegetation:
  - Must be non-agricultural, native, or naturalized.
  - Millet is a special case: planted millet is not “natural vegetation” in the year of planting, but volunteer millet in later years is.
