Key concepts / sections (CFR Title 50, Part 20, Subparts D–E)

Subpart D — Possession

- § 20.31 Prohibited if taken in violation of subpart C  
  - You may not possess any migratory game bird (or part) that was taken in violation of the hunting regulations in Subpart C (e.g., out of season, over limit, etc.).

- § 20.32 During closed season  
  - You may not possess any *freshly killed* migratory game birds during the closed season.

- § 20.33 Possession limit  
  - You may not possess more migratory game birds (taken in the U.S.) than:
    - the possession limit, or  
    - the *aggregate* possession limit,  
    whichever applies.

- § 20.34 Opening day of a season  
  - On opening day, you may not possess more freshly killed birds than:
    - the daily bag limit or aggregate daily bag limit, whichever applies.  
  - Prevents stockpiling from earlier that same day.

- § 20.35 Field possession limit  
  - Between the place where birds are taken and any of the following, you may not possess more than the daily bag limit (or aggregate daily bag limit):
    - Your car or main land transport
    - Your home or temporary/transient lodging
    - A migratory bird preservation facility
    - A post office
    - A common carrier facility  
  - Applies whether birds are tagged or not.

- § 20.36 Tagging requirement  
  - You may not leave birds anywhere other than your own home, or with another person for:
    - picking/cleaning/processing
    - shipping/transportation
    - storage (including temporary)
    - taxidermy  
    unless the birds are tagged with:
    - hunter’s signature
    - hunter’s address
    - total number and species
    - date killed  
  - Birds in your vehicle as your *personal baggage* are *not* considered in storage.

- § 20.37 Custody of birds of another  
  - You may not receive or hold birds that belong to someone else unless they are properly tagged as in § 20.36.

- § 20.38 Possession of live birds  
  - Any wounded bird reduced to possession must be immediately killed and counts toward the daily bag limit.
  - No possession or transport of live migratory game birds taken under this part is allowed.

- § 20.39 Termination of possession  
  - Your legal “possession” of birds ends when:
    - you give them to someone else as a gift, or
    - you deliver them to a post office, common carrier, or migratory bird preservation facility, consigned for transport to someone other than yourself.  
  - Other requirements in this part still apply (e.g., tagging, gifting rules).

- § 20.40 Gift of migratory game birds  
  - You cannot receive, possess, or give *freshly killed* birds as a gift, except at the donor’s or recipient’s home, unless the birds:
    - have a tag signed by the hunter, with:
      - hunter’s address
      - total number and species
      - date taken.

Subpart E — Transportation Within the United States

- § 20.41 Prohibited if taken in violation of subpart C  
  - You may not transport any migratory game bird (or part) taken in violation of Subpart C.

- § 20.42 Transportation of birds of another  
  - You may not transport someone else’s birds unless they are tagged as required by § 20.36.

- § 20.43 Species identification requirement  
  - Prohibits transport of migratory game birds within the U.S. without species identification (text continues in next chunk).  
  - Doves are an exception; other birds must remain identifiable to species.

Definitions / core ideas

- Daily bag limit: Maximum number you may take in one day.  
- Possession limit: Max number you may possess at one time (often a multiple of the daily bag).  
- Aggregate limits: Combined limits when multiple species/areas apply.  
- “Freshly killed”: Recently killed birds (not clearly processed or stored long-term).  
- Termination of possession: Legally ends when you gift birds or consign them to mail/carrier/facility for someone else, following tagging rules.

Examples (implied applications)

- Leaving birds at a processor: Must be tagged with your name, address, species/number, and date killed.  
- Transporting a friend’s birds: Only legal if each bundle is properly tagged by that friend.  
- Wounded duck you pick up: Must be killed immediately and counts toward your daily limit.

Common pitfalls / confusions

- Forgetting tagging:
  - Anytime birds leave your personal abode or are left with anyone else (processor, taxidermist, friend, shipper), they must be tagged.
- Assuming “in my truck” = “storage”:
  - Birds in your vehicle as your personal baggage are *not* “storage,” but field possession and bag/field limits still apply.
- Exceeding limits on opening day:
  - You cannot have more freshly killed birds than the daily limit on opening day (you can’t “carry over” from earlier that same day).
- Gifting rules:
  - Freshly killed birds given away outside a home require tags; gifts at donor’s or donee’s residence are the exception.
- Live birds:
  - It is illegal to keep wounded birds alive in possession; they must be dispatched and counted in the bag.
