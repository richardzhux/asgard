# Chunk 04 (units 2461-3360)

Key Concepts / Sections

- Hunter Survey (preceding context)
  - Licensed migratory bird hunters may be asked annually to report:
    - Approximate number of ducks, geese, doves, woodcock bagged in previous year.
    - Whether they hunted coots, snipe, rails, gallinules.
    - In band-tailed pigeon States: whether they intend to hunt band‑tailed pigeons in current year.

- §20.21 – Illegal Hunting Methods
  - General rule: Migratory game birds with open seasons may be taken by any method **except** those specifically prohibited in §20.21.

Subsection-by-Subsection

(a) Prohibited devices and substances
  - Illegal to take migratory game birds with:
    - Trap, snare, net
    - Rifle, pistol
    - Swivel gun, shotgun > 10 gauge
    - Punt gun, battery gun, machine gun
    - Fish hook
    - Poison, drug, explosive, stupefying substance

(b) Shotgun capacity limit
  - Shotgun must not be capable of holding **more than 3 shells** (magazine + chamber).
  - Must be plugged with a **one-piece, non-removable (without disassembly) filler** to limit capacity to 3.
  - Exception: **Light-goose-only seasons** (lesser snow and Ross’ geese) in listed Central & Mississippi Flyway States, when:
    - All other waterfowl and crane seasons (except falconry) are closed, and
    - You are hunting light geese.

(c) Sinkbox / low floating devices
  - Illegal to hunt:
    - From a sinkbox or any low floating device with a depression allowing concealment **below water surface**.

(d) Motor vehicles / land conveyances / aircraft
  - Illegal to hunt:
    - From or by means of any motor vehicle, motor-driven land conveyance, or aircraft.
  - Exception:
    - Paraplegics and persons missing one or both legs may take birds from a **stationary** motor vehicle or motor-driven land conveyance.

(e) Motorboats and sailboats
  - Illegal to shoot:
    - From any motorboat or craft with a motor, or any sailboat, **unless**:
      - Motor is completely shut off and/or sails are furled, **and**
      - The craft’s progress has **fully ceased**.
  - Allowed:
    - Use of powered craft to retrieve dead or crippled birds.
    - But you may **not shoot crippled birds while the craft is under power**, except in the seaduck areas permitted in subpart K.

(f) Live decoy birds
  - Illegal to take migratory waterfowl:
    - By the use or aid of live birds as decoys.
    - Includes hunting where tame/captive ducks or geese are present **unless**:
      - They have been confined for **10 consecutive days** before hunting in an enclosure that:
        - Substantially reduces audibility of their calls, and
        - Completely conceals them from sight of wild birds.

(g) Recorded / amplified calls
  - Illegal to use:
    - Recorded or electrically amplified bird calls or sounds, or their imitations.
  - Exception:
    - During light-goose-only seasons in listed Central & Mississippi Flyway States, when all other waterfowl and crane seasons (except falconry) are closed, for hunting lesser snow and Ross’ geese.

(h) Using vehicles to drive or concentrate birds
  - Illegal to use:
    - Any motor-driven land, water, or air conveyance, or sailboat, for the purpose of:
      - Concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up migratory birds.
  - Note: This is about **herding/flushing** with vehicles, not simply transportation.

(i) Baiting
  - General prohibition:
    - Illegal to take migratory game birds **by aid of baiting** or **on/over any baited area** where the person **knows or reasonably should know** the area is or has been baited.
  - Important definition (from context of regulation, not fully in this chunk):
    - “Baited area” involves placing, exposing, depositing, distributing grain or feed to lure birds.
  - Explicitly allowed (not considered baiting if otherwise lawful):
    1. Taking birds (including waterfowl, coots, cranes) on or over:
       - Standing or flooded standing crops (including aquatics).
       - Standing, flooded, or manipulated natural vegetation.
       - Flooded harvested croplands.
       - Areas where seeds/grain are present **solely** as the result of:
         - Normal agricultural planting.
         - Normal harvesting.
         - Normal post-harvest manipulation.
         - Normal soil stabilization practices.
    2. From blinds or concealment:
       - Camouflaged with **natural vegetation**.
       - Camouflaged with **vegetation from agricultural crops**, as long as:
         - The camouflaging does **not** expose, deposit, distribute, or scatter grain or other feed.
    3. Standing or flooded standing agricultural crops where grain is scattered **only inadvertently** by hunters entering (text cuts off, but intent is clear).

Examples (implicit)

- Legal:
  - Hunting ducks over a naturally flooded corn field that was **normally planted and harvested**, with no extra grain added.
  - Using a plugged 12-gauge holding only 3 shells while duck hunting.
  - Using a motorboat to pick up downed ducks, **motor off** when shooting, and no shooting while under power (except seaduck area rules).

- Illegal:
  - Using an electronic caller for ducks during the regular season.
  - Hunting geese over a field where grain was dumped to attract them.
  - Shooting from a moving motorboat or from an ATV.
  - Hunting from a sinkbox concealed below the water surface.
  - Hunting ducks near captive decoy ducks that are visible/audible and not properly enclosed for 10 days.

Pitfalls / Common Confusions

- Shotgun plug:
  - Plug must be **one piece** and **not removable without disassembling** the gun.
  - 3-shell limit includes both magazine and chamber.

- Light-goose-only exceptions:
  - Extra shells and electronic calls are allowed **only**:
    - For **lesser snow and Ross’ geese**,
    - In specified Central & Mississippi Flyway States,
    - When **all other waterfowl and crane** seasons (except falconry) are closed.
  - Hunters often misapply this to other species or states.

- Boats:
  - Boat must be **dead
