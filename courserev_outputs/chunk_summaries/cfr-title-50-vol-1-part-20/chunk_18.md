# Chunk 18 (units 13941-14189)

**Key Concepts / Sections**

- **Purpose of Part 21 (intro paragraph)**
  - Supplements **general permit regulations in Part 13** for activities involving migratory birds:
    - Taking, possession, transportation
    - Sale, purchase, barter
    - Importation, exportation
    - Banding or marking
  - Provides:
    - **Exceptions** to permit requirements for **public, scientific, or educational institutions**.
    - **Depredation orders** = limited exceptions to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA, 16 U.S.C. 703–712) allowing certain control of birds causing damage.

- **§ 21.2 Scope of Regulations**

  **(a) Grandfathered migratory birds**
  - Migratory birds (and their parts, nests, eggs) **lawfully acquired before** they became federally protected under the MBTA:
    - **May** be **possessed** and **transported** without a permit.
    - **May NOT** be:
      - Imported or exported
      - Purchased, sold, or bartered
      - Offered for purchase, sale, or barter
    - **Shipments** of such birds must be **marked** as required by **Part 14** (labeling of wildlife shipments).
    - **No exemption for offspring**: Any offspring of these birds are fully subject to MBTA and permit rules (no “inherited” exemption).

  **(b) Bald and golden eagles**
  - Part 21 **does not apply** to:
    - Bald eagle (*Haliaeetus leucocephalus*)
    - Golden eagle (*Aquila chrysaetos*)
  - **Exception:** § 21.22 (banding or marking permits) still applies.
  - All other regulations for eagles are in **Part 22**.

  **(c) Relationship to other regulations**
  - Part 21’s provisions are **in addition to**, not a replacement for, other applicable regulations (sentence cut, but meaning is clear).

**Definitions / Concepts**

- **Depredation order**: A regulation that authorizes specified persons to take certain migratory birds under defined conditions to prevent or reduce damage (e.g., to crops, property, or public health), within limits of the MBTA.

- **Lawfully acquired prior to Federal protection**: Obtained in compliance with then-current law before the species or population was added under MBTA protection.

---

**Examples (Implied)**

- A museum with bird specimens collected before the species became MBTA‑protected:
  - Can **keep and move** the specimens without a permit.
  - **Cannot sell** or trade them.
  - Must **properly mark** any shipment (per Part 14).
  - Any chicks hatched from eggs of those birds are **fully regulated** under MBTA.

---

**Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

- Thinking that “old” or “grandfathered” birds or specimens can be **sold or traded**:  
  - They **cannot** be imported, exported, bought, sold, bartered, or offered for such transactions.

- Assuming the exemption extends to **offspring**:
  - Offspring **do not** inherit the exemption; they are fully protected under current law.

- Applying Part 21 rules to **bald or golden eagles**:
  - Those species are regulated under **Part 22**, except for banding/marking permits in § 21.22.

- Ignoring shipment marking rules:
  - Even lawfully acquired, pre‑protection specimens must observe **Part 14** marking requirements when shipped.
