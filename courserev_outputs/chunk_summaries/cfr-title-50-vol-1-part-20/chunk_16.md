Definitions / rules

- **Test setup (Tier 3 reproduction test – continued details)**  
  - Birds given corn ad libitum for 60 days, then paired (one pair/pen) and given commercial breeder mash.  
  - Dosing groups:
    - Positive control: 1 pellet of No. 4 lead shot.  
    - Negative control: 8 pellets of No. 4 steel shot.  
    - Test group: 8 pellets of No. 4 candidate or coated shot.  
  - Dosing at day 0 (after acclimation), then redosed at 30, 60, and 90 days.  
  - Expectation: few, if any, lead‑dosed birds should survive and reproduce (ensures test sensitivity).

- **Measurements on adults (Tier 3)**  
  - Fluoroscopy 1 week after dosage to check shot retention.  
  - Weigh males and females at:
    - Day 0 (initial dose), each subsequent dosing, and at death.  
  - Collect blood at weighing to measure the **same blood parameters** as in the 30‑Day Acute Toxicity Test.  
  - Reproduction:
    - Record date of first egg and mean days per egg laid.  
    - Stop laying either after 21 normal, uncracked eggs, or after 150 days.  
  - After laying period:
    - Sacrifice adults, remove liver and other appropriate organs for **histopathology**.  
    - Analyze organs and the **11th egg** for chemicals present in the shot / coating.  
    - Necropsy all birds that die to determine pathological conditions.  
  - Eggs:
    - Collect daily; discard eggs laid before pairing.  
    - Artificially incubate and calculate:
      - Percent shell thickness  
      - Percent eggs cracked  
      - Percent fertility (by candling)  
      - Percent hatch of fertile eggs  

- **Measurements on ducklings (Tier 3)**  
  - Provide starter mash after hatching.  
  - Sacrifice at 14 days of age.  
  - Record:
    - Survival to day 14  
    - Weight at hatching and at sacrifice  
    - Blood parameters (same set as 30‑Day Acute Toxicity Test at sacrifice).

- **Typical test analyses and statistical standards (§ 20.155(b)(3))**  
  - **Criterion vs. steel shot**:  
    - Any mortality, reproductive inhibition, or physiological effects caused by the candidate shot/coating **must not be significantly greater than** those caused by steel shot.  
  - Statistics:
    - Percentage data → **arcsine square root transformation** before analysis.  
    - Physiological and reproductive data → **one‑tailed t‑tests** at α = 0.05, or other appropriate procedures.

- **Regulatory decision process after Tier 3**  
  - Applicant must submit Tier 3 results to the Director.  
  - **If data do not show that the shot/coating is safe** (no significant danger):
    - Service may find results inconclusive.  
    - Applicant can choose to repeat the tests deemed inconclusive.  
    - If applicant refuses to repeat → approval is **denied**.  
    - Service issues a **Notice of Review** stating:
      - Tier 3 results are inconclusive,  
      - Applicant’s decision not to repeat,  
      - Service’s denial.  
  - **If Tier 3 data (initial or repeated) support safety**:
    - Service makes a **preliminary determination** that the shot/coating is not a significant danger to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats.  
    - Director publishes a **proposed rule** in the Federal Register:
      - Announces intent to approve,  
      - Provides public comment opportunity,  
      - Describes chemical composition and summarizes Tier 3 findings.  
    - After comment period, if Service still concludes “no significant danger”:
      - Shot/coating is approved as **nontoxic** via **final rule** in the Federal Register.

- **Residual lead levels in shot (§ 20.155(b)(5))**  
  - Maximum environmentally acceptable lead content in “nontoxic” shot:  
    - **Trace amounts or <1 percent lead**.  
  - Any shot with **≥1 percent lead** is considered **toxic and illegal** for use in migratory bird hunting.

- **Field detection device requirement (§ 20.155(b)(6))**  
  - Before approval of any shot for migratory game bird hunting, there must be a **noninvasive field testing device** available.  
  - Purpose: allow enforcement officers to determine **shot material in a shell in the field**.

- **Subpart N—Special Procedures for Issuance of Annual Hunting Regulations (§ 20.151)**  
  - **Purpose and scope**:
    - Applies to issuance of **annual regulations** that set:
      - Seasons  
      - Bag limits  
      - Other requirements for **seasonal hunting of migratory birds**.  
    - Does **not** apply to regulations issued under **part 21** (e.g., depredation permits, special purpose permits, etc.).

Examples (from text)

- Positive vs. negative control in Tier 3:
  - Lead shot as a **positive control** to demonstrate toxicity (few, if any, birds should survive/reproduce).  
  - Steel shot as **negative control** (standard of acceptable effect level).

Common pitfalls / confusions

- Assuming “nontoxic” shot can contain any small amount of lead:  
  - The regulation draws a strict line: **<1% = acceptable trace; ≥1% = toxic/illegal**.
- Misinterpreting Tier 3 outcome:  
  - Passing Tier 3 does **not** itself approve the shot; it only leads to a **proposed rule** and public comment, then a **final rule** if still deemed safe.
- Ignoring the comparison standard:  
  - Effects of candidate shot must be **no worse than steel shot**; comparison is not just to “zero effect.”
- Overlooking enforcement requirement:  
  - A shot type cannot be approved unless a **field‑usable, noninvasive detection device** exists for it.
