### Core Regulatory Points (Subpart A)

**§20.1 Scope of Regulations**
- **Coverage:**
  - Applies **only** to:
    - **Hunting of migratory game birds**, and
    - **Hunting of crows**.
- **Activities controlled for migratory game birds:**
  - May be **taken, possessed, transported, shipped, exported, or imported** only if you comply with **all restrictions in Part 20**.
- **Activities controlled for crows:**
  - May be **taken, possessed, transported, or exported/imported** only in accordance with:
    - **Subpart H** (law violations) and
    - **§20.133** (special crow hunting regulations).

**§20.2 Relation to Other Provisions**
- **(a) Migratory bird permits (Part 21):**
  - Part 20 **does not change the terms** of any permit issued under **Part 21**.
  - You must comply with **both**: your permit conditions **and** Part 20 hunting rules, where applicable.
- **(b) Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act (Duck Stamp):**
  - Part 20 rules are **in addition to** the Duck Stamp requirements (16 U.S.C. 718a).
  - Having a duck stamp **does not by itself authorize** any hunting that violates Part 20.
- **(c) National Wildlife Refuges (NWRS Admin. Act):**
  - Part 20 rules are **in addition to** any special rules on **National Wildlife Refuges** (16 U.S.C. 668dd).
  - Refuges can have **stricter rules** than Part 20.
- **(d) State laws for protection of migratory birds (incomplete text):**
  - The idea (consistent with MBTA framework): **state law cannot relieve you from federal responsibilities**.
  - If state law is more restrictive, you must comply with **both state and federal** requirements.

  Permits might be issued to protect:

  (These are used as reporting categories, not detailed here as hunting rules.)

### Pitfalls / Common Confusions

- **Migratory game birds vs. crows**  
  - Migratory game birds are regulated across **all** relevant subparts of Part 20.  
  - **Crows** have **their own specific hunting rules** in **§20.133** but are also subject to general law-violation provisions in **Subpart H**. Don’t assume crow hunting follows the same seasons/limits as ducks, geese, etc.

- **Federal vs. State vs. Refuge rules**
  - Compliance is **cumulative**:
    - You must follow **federal Part 20**, **state** hunting laws, and any **refuge-specific** rules.
  - A **more lenient state law** does **not** let you ignore stricter federal rules.
  - A **refuge** may completely close or further restrict hunting even when Part 20 allows it.

- **Permits vs. hunting regulations**
  - A
