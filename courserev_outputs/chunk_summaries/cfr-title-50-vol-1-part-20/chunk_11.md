# Chunk 11 (units 8201-9100)

Key concepts / sections
- §20.134 Nontoxic shot
  - (a) Approval
    - OMB-approved information collection (No. 1018–0067).
    - Purpose: provide data so the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), can objectively decide whether a candidate shot/shot coating is “nontoxic” for use under 50 CFR 20.21(j).
    - Standard: Spent shot must not pose a “significant danger” to migratory birds, other wildlife, or their habitats.
  - (b) Application and review – Tiered strategy
    - Applications must be submitted to the Director.
    - Must at least include all Tier 1 information.
    - FWS or an independent lab may chemically analyze shot to verify composition; application can be rejected if incomplete or if composition differs significantly from what is described.

Tier 1 requirements

1. Basic product and use information – §20.134(b)(2)(i)(A)
   - Statement of proposed use:
     - Purpose and types of uses.
   - Chemical characterization of intact material:
     - Chemical names, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers (if available), and chemical structures.
     - For organic/organometallic coating and core: empirical formula, melting point, molecular weight, solubility, specific gravity, partition coefficients, hydrolysis half-life, leaching rate (water/soil), degradation half-life, vapor pressure, stability, etc.
     - Composition and weight of shot material.
     - Coating details: thickness, quantity (e.g., mg/shot), chemical composition.
   - Expected variability in production:
     - How much composition can vary batch-to-batch.
   - Estimated yearly volume:
     - How much (uncoated or coated) shot will be used in U.S. migratory bird hunting.
   - Physical sample:
     - 5 pounds of candidate shot/coated shot, in U.S. standard size No. 4 (0.13 in diameter).

2. Toxicological information – §20.134(b)(2)(i)(B)
   - Mammalian toxicity:
     - Summary of acute and chronic toxicity of shot/shot coating with ranking by LD50 (mg/kg) and citations:
       - LD50 < 5: super toxic  
       - 5–50: extremely toxic  
       - 50–500: very toxic  
       - 500–5,000: moderately toxic  
       - 5,000–15,000: slightly toxic  
       - >15,000: practically nontoxic
   - Avian toxicity (esp. waterfowl):
     - Acute, chronic, reproductive data for component chemicals (LD50, LC50, sublethal effects) with citations.
   - Predicted effect of ingestion by waterfowl:
     - Narrative prediction (with citations) of toxic effect if one shot (or coated shot) is completely eroded and absorbed in 24 hours.
     - Must define effect: mortality, impaired reproduction, substantial weight loss, disorientation, other clinical signs.
   - Other taxa:
     - Statement (with rationale and citations) whether there is reasonable concern for ingestion by fish, amphibians, reptiles, or mammals.
     - If recognized impacts exist, FWS may require additional studies.
   - Broader toxicity summary:
     - Toxicity of component chemicals to aquatic/terrestrial invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals.

3. Environmental fate and transport – §20.134(b)(2)(i)(C)
   - Changes upon firing:
     - Statement describing any physical or chemical alteration of shot/shot coating during firing.
   - Environmental persistence:
     - Estimate environmental half-life of organic/organometallic components.
     - Describe chemical form(s) of breakdown products.
   - Estimated Environmental Concentration (EEC):
     - Assume 69,000 shot per hectare (Bellrose 1959; Pain 1990).
     - Terrestrial scenario: assume complete dissolution into top 5 cm of soil.
       - Calculate EEC and compare to existing “clean soil” standards (EPA, etc.).

Definitions / key terms
- Nontoxic shot (regulatory sense): A shot material that, based on data and review, “does not impose a significant danger” to migratory birds, other wildlife, or habitats.
- LD50 (median lethal dose): Dose (mg/kg body weight) causing death in 50% of test animals; used to classify toxicity categories listed above.
- LC50 (median lethal concentration): Concentration in environment (e.g., water) causing 50% mortality in test organisms.
- EEC (Estimated Environmental Concentration): Predicted concentration of a substance in an environmental compartment (e.g., soil), given an assumed loading (here, 69,000 shot/ha).

Examples (implicit)
- Example assumption for EEC:
  - 69,000 shot per hectare (reference: Bellrose 1959; Pain 1990).
  - All material dissolves into the upper 5 cm of soil – used as a worst-case scenario for soil concentration.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Nontoxic” is not colloquial:
  - A shot can contain toxic elements/compounds but still be considered “nontoxic” in this rule if, in real use, it does not create significant ecological risk at expected exposure levels.
- Composition vs. performance:
  - Approval is about toxicity and environmental fate, not ballistic performance.
- Variability matters:
  - Applicants must address production variability; large uncontrolled variations in composition can cause rejection even if the “nominal” formula looks safe.
- Toxicity ranking:
  - Do not confuse the regulatory LD50 categories with consumer safety labels; they are standardized toxicological classifications used to compare candidates.
- Partial data:
  - Lack of data for some taxa (e.g., amphibians) must be acknowledged with rationale; FWS may ask for more studies if concern is plausible.
