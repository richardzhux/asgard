# Chunk 12 (units 9021-9920)

Key concepts / sections
- Estimated Environmental Concentration (EEC) requirements
  - Must be calculated assuming 69,000 shot per hectare.
  - Two ecosystems:
    - Terrestrial: assume complete dissolution in top 5 cm of soil.
      - Compare resulting EEC to:
        - EPA “clean soil” standards (40 CFR part 503, sewage sludge use/disposal).
        - Toxicity thresholds for plants, invertebrates, fish, wildlife.
    - Aquatic: assume complete dissolution of shot or coating in 1 cubic foot of water.
      - Compare resulting EEC to:
        - EPA Water Quality Criteria.
        - Toxicity thresholds for plants, invertebrates, fish, wildlife.
  - Must describe:
    - Environmental half-life of the organic/organometallic component.
    - Chemical form of breakdown products.

- Service evaluation of a Tier 1 application
  - Level of concern:
    - Exceedence of 1 LD50 per square foot used as a criterion (from U.S. EPA 1992).
  - Risk assessment method:
    - Uses the Quotient Method (EPA 1986).

Definitions / formulas
- Risk Quotient (Q):
  - Formula:  
    `Risk = EEC / Toxicological Level of Concern`
    - EEC usually in ppm.
    - Toxicological Level of Concern often an LD50 (in ppm or compatible units).
  - Interpretation of Q:
    - Q < 0.1 → No Adverse Effects
    - 0.1 ≤ Q ≤ 10.0 → Possible Adverse Effects
    - Q > 10.0 → Probable Adverse Effects

Regulatory process & timelines (Tier 1)
- Completeness check:
  - Within 30 days of receipt, Service decides if the Tier 1 submission is complete.
  - If complete → applicant notified and full review begins.
- Public notice:
  - A Notice of Application is published in the Federal Register to announce start of Tier 1 review.
- Review time:
  - Complete Tier 1 review occurs within 60 days of the Federal Register notice.
- Outcomes after Tier 1:
  1) Inconclusive / potential concern:
     - If Service does NOT conclude that the shot/coat “does not impose a significant danger,” the applicant is advised to proceed with Tier 2, Tier 3, or both.
     - A Notice of Review published explaining that Tier 1 was inconclusive and further testing is required.
  2) Preliminary approval:
     - If Tier 1 suggests no significant danger:
       - Director publishes a proposed rule in the Federal Register stating intent to approve.
       - Proposal includes:
         - Chemical composition of the candidate shot/shot coating.
         - Summary of Tier 1 findings.
       - After public comment:
         - If no technical/scientific basis to change conclusion → final rule published; material approved.
         - If information still does not establish lack of significant danger → Tier 2, Tier 3, or both required; Notice of Review explains which tiers and why.
  - If only Tier 2 or only Tier 3 is required, the notice must explain why the other tier is not needed.
  - If applicant chooses not to proceed with further tiers → denial of approval is published in the Federal Register.

Tier 2 overview
- If Tier 2 required:
  - Applicant must submit a detailed Tier 2 testing plan addressing the specified Tier 2 requirements.
  - Director reviews plan within 30 days.
    - May refuse approval of the plan (fully or partially) if timing, format, or content is deficient.
    - Will specify which parts to disregard and what modifications are required.
  - All testing must comply with Good Laboratory Practice Standards (40 CFR part 160), except where:
    - They conflict with this section’s regulations, or
    - They conflict with an approved plan.
  - Director (or representative) may inspect laboratory facilities.
    - May deny plan approval and further consideration if GLP standards are not met.
  - Once plan is accepted, Tier 2 testing and required analyses/reports begin.

Examples
- Conceptual EEC example setups (no numbers given in the text):
  - Soil: Calculate concentration if all metal from 69,000 shot/ha dissolves in 5 cm of soil; compare to 40 CFR part 503 limits.
  - Water: Calculate concentration if all metal from a single shot dose dissolves in 1 ft³ of water; compare to EPA Water Quality Criteria.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Double negative wording:
  - “If the Service does not conclude that the shot … does not impose a significant danger…”  
    → Means: if Tier 1 does not clearly show safety, more testing (Tier 2/3) is required.
- Units and comparability:
  - EEC and toxicity metrics must be in compatible units (e.g., ppm vs mg/kg).
  - LD50 per square foot vs LD50 in ppm are conceptually related but not the same:
    - 1 LD50/sq ft is used as a spatial exposure level of concern; separate from the Q thresholds.
- Assumptions in EEC:
  - “Complete dissolution” is conservative (worst-case) and may overestimate real-world exposure; this is intentional for safety.
  - 69,000 shot/ha and 5 cm soil depth, or 1 ft³ water, are standardized assumptions for comparison across materials.
