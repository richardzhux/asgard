Key concepts / sections

- **Laboratory plan & inspection**
  - Director (or representative) may inspect the applicant’s lab for compliance with **Good Laboratory Practice Standards**.
  - If the facility does not comply, the Director may refuse to approve the plan and stop further consideration of the candidate shot.
  - After plan acceptance, **Tier 2 testing** begins.
  - Applicant must submit required analyses and reports, including **all raw data and statistical analyses**, with lab reports and final comprehensive report.

- **Tier 2 testing overview**
  1. **In vitro erosion test** (simulated gizzard conditions).
  2. **30‑day acute toxicity test in mallards**.
  3. Additional test on **selected invertebrates and fish** (mentioned, details elsewhere).
  - Erosion and toxicity characteristics are always **compared to lead shot and steel shot** of comparable size.

- **In vitro erosion rate test (Kimball & Munir 1971)**
  - Purpose: Measure how fast the candidate shot or coating erodes and releases components in a simulated waterfowl gizzard environment.
  - Typical materials:
    - Atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
    - Drilled aluminum block (to hold test tubes).
    - Thermostatically controlled stirring hot plate.
    - Small Teflon‑coated magnets.
    - Hydrochloric acid (pH 2.0) + pepsin.
    - Capped test tubes.
    - Lead shot, steel shot, and candidate shot/coated shot.
  - Typical procedure:
    - Add HCl + pepsin at a volume/concentration that will erode a single lead shot at **≈5 mg/day**.
    - Three tubes: one with **lead**, one with **steel**, one with **candidate** shot/coated shot.
    - Place tubes in aluminum block on hot plate:
      - **42 °C**, **500 rpm** stirring with Teflon magnet.
    - For **14 consecutive days**:
      - Weigh shot to determine mass loss (erosion).
      - Analyze digestion solution with atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
    - **Replicate the 14‑day run five times**.
  - Typical analyses:
    - Compare erosion rates of lead, steel, and candidate using:
      - **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)** and **regression**.
    - Determine whether candidate’s erosion rate is **significantly greater or less** than lead and steel.
    - This result guides interpretation of subsequent toxicity data.

- **30‑day acute toxicity test in mallards (Tier 2)**
  - Purpose: Assess short‑term toxicity of candidate shot/coating in waterfowl.
  - Test animals & setup:
    - **30 male + 30 female** hand‑reared mallards, **6–8 months** old, with wild‑type plumage/body conformation.
    - **60 elevated outdoor pens**, each with feeder and waterer.
    - Lab capability for fluoroscopy, blood/tissue assays, necropsy.
    - Use **commercial duck maintenance mash** as diet.
  - Dosing design:
    - House mallards individually with ad libitum food/water for **3 weeks** (acclimation).
    - Randomly assign to **3 groups**:
      - 10 ♂ + 10 ♀ per group.
      - Dose with **8 pellets** of:
        - No. 4 **lead shot** (positive control),
        - **Steel shot** (negative control),
        - **Candidate shot/coated shot**.
    - **Fluoroscope at 1 week** post‑dose to verify shot retention.
  - Observations & measurements:
    - Observe **daily** for clinical signs and mortality during the **30‑day** test.
    - Body weights: at dosing (day 0), **day 15**, **day 30**.
    - On days 15 and 30:
      - Collect blood via venipuncture.
      - Measure **hematocrit**, **hemoglobin**, and other specified blood chemistries.
    - On **day 30**:
      - Sacrifice all survivors.
      - Collect liver and other relevant organs for **histopathology**.
      - Analyze organs for **lead** and candidate‑shot components.
    - Necropsy:
      - All birds that die before day 30.
      - All birds sacrificed on day 30.
      - Record any pathological findings.
  - Typical analyses:
    - **Mortality** among groups: analyze using **chi‑square** tests.
    - **Physiological data and tissue contaminant levels**:
      - Analyze with **ANOVA or other appropriate statistics**.
      - Include factors for **shot type** and **sex**.
      - Compare birds that died early vs. sacrificed at day 30 when sample size allows.
