     - Max **25 doves** (total, all dove species).
     - Max **10 pigeons** (total, all pigeon species).
   - From **Mexico**:
     - Max is **Mexican daily bag limit**,  
       OR, if hunting permit is date‑stamped on first hunt day by Mexican wildlife authorities:
       - You may import the **Mexican possession limit** corresponding to the number of days actually hunted on that trip.

   **Waterfowl**
   - From **any foreign country except Canada and Mexico** (per calendar week, Sunday–Saturday):
     - Max **10 ducks** (total, all duck species).
     - Max **5 geese including brant** (total, all goose/brant species).
   - From **Canada**:
     - Max is the amount **Canadian authorities allow to be exported**.
   - From **Mexico**:
     - Same rule as doves/pigeons: check Mexican daily limit, or use date‑stamped permit to use **Mexican possession limit** based on days actually hunted.

2. **Importing birds of another person – § 20.62**
   - You may **not** import migratory game birds that **belong to another person**.

3. **Species identification on import – § 20.63**
   - Each imported migratory game bird must have **one fully feathered wing attached**.
   - That wing must remain attached while being transported:

     - From port of entry to a migratory bird preservation facility.

4. **Foreign export permits – § 20.64**

5. **Processing requirement (foreign‑taken birds) – § 20.65**
   - For migratory game birds killed in any foreign country **except Canada**, they must be:
     - **Dressed** (plucked or partially plucked, as customary),
     - **Drawn** (eviscerated),
     - **Head and feet removed**,  
       except as needed to comply with the wing requirement in § 20.63.
   - **Exception (Taxidermy):**
     - Fully feathered birds may be imported **for mounting** if:
       - Consigned to a taxidermist with a **current § 21.24 taxidermist permit**, and
       - That taxidermist is also **licensed by USDA to decontaminate** such birds.

6. **Marking of packages/containers on import – § 20.66 (partial text)**
   - Same basic idea as domestic/export:
     - Packages imported via Postal Service or common carrier must show name and address (full details continue beyond this chunk).

### Common Pitfalls & Confusions

- **Weekly vs daily/possession limits:**

  - For **Mexico**, you often follow **Mexican daily or possession limits
