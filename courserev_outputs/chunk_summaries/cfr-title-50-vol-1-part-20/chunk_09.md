# Chunk 09 (units 6561-7460)

Key concepts / sections

- General framework (following Migratory Bird Treaty Act)
  - Hunting migratory game birds is prohibited unless annual regulatory schedules are set.
  - Schedules include: seasons, daily bag limits, possession limits, and shooting (or hawking) hours.
  - Populations and habitat vary annually by flyway, state, and even sub‑state areas → requires annual adjustment.
  - Process:
    - Data gathering on populations, habitat, harvest, etc.
    - Proposed schedules published in spring.
    - Modified based on new data and public comments.
    - Supplemental proposals also open to public comment.
    - Public hearings provide additional participation.

- § 20.101 – Puerto Rico & Virgin Islands
  - Covers annual hunting seasons for:
    - Puerto Rico: certain doves, pigeons, ducks, coots, gallinules, snipe.
    - Virgin Islands: certain doves, pigeons, ducks.
  - Nontoxic shot required for waterfowl and coots (and some other species as applicable) starting 1991–92 waterfowl season.

- § 20.102 – Alaska
  - Covers annual hunting seasons for:
    - Certain waterfowl (ducks, tundra swans, geese, brant), common snipe, sandhill cranes.
  - Nontoxic shot required for waterfowl starting 1991–92 season.

- § 20.103 – Mourning & white‑winged doves, wild pigeons (48 contiguous states)
  - Provides annual hunting regulations for certain doves and pigeons.
  - Mourning dove regs organized by Management Units:
    - Eastern, Central, Western.

- § 20.104 – Rails, woodcock, common (Wilson’s) snipe (48 contiguous states)
  - Provides annual hunting regulations for these species.

- § 20.105 – Waterfowl, coots, gallinules (48 contiguous states)
  - Covers annual hunting of:
    - Waterfowl (ducks, geese including brant), coots, gallinules.
  - Organized by flyway:
    - Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, Pacific.
  - Regs often vary:
    - Within flyways, within states, and by time periods.
  - Territorial/coastal waters:
    - U.S. areas outside state boundaries (territorial waters seaward of county boundaries, plus coastal waters claimed by states not already in § 20.108 zones) are designated nontoxic shot zones for waterfowl hunting beginning 1991–92.

- § 20.106 – Sandhill cranes (48 contiguous states)
  - Provides annual hunting seasons for sandhill cranes in designated portions of the contiguous U.S.

- § 20.107 – Tundra swans (48 contiguous states)
  - Provides annual hunting seasons for tundra swans in designated portions of the contiguous U.S.

Definitions / key terms

- Nontoxic shot: Ammunition that does not contain toxic materials (e.g., lead); mandatory for waterfowl (and some other species) in specified areas and seasons.
- Flyway: Large migratory corridor used for management (Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, Pacific).
- Management Unit (for doves): Regional division (Eastern, Central, Western) used to set dove regulations.
- Territorial waters: U.S. waters outside state boundaries, seaward of county boundaries, plus some coastal waters.

Examples (implicit)

- Different regions have different regulatory frameworks:
  - Doves → Management Units (Eastern/Central/Western).
  - Waterfowl → Flyways (Atlantic/Mississippi/Central/Pacific).
  - Alaska, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands have separate sections due to distinct conditions.

Pitfalls / common confusions

- Assuming rules are uniform nationwide:
  - In reality, regulations vary by state, flyway, management unit, and even sub‑areas.
- Overlooking annual changes:
  - Schedules are revised every year; must consult current Federal Register / List of CFR Sections Affected.
- Confusing flyways with management units:
  - Flyways apply mainly to waterfowl; management units used for mourning doves.
- Missing nontoxic shot requirements:
  - Requirements differ by region and species; especially strict for waterfowl and related species from 1991–92 onward.
