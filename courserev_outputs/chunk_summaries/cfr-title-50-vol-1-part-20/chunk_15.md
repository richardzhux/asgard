# Chunk 15 (units 11481-12380)

Key concepts / sections
- Tier 3 testing requirements for candidate non-toxic shot or shot coatings:
  - (A) Chronic toxicity test under depressed temperature conditions with nutritionally-deficient diet.
  - (B) Chronic dosage (reproduction) study.

- Oversight and lab standards:
  - Director (or representative) may inspect lab facilities.
  - Approval can be denied if lab does not comply with Good Laboratory Practices.
  - All raw data and statistical analyses must accompany lab and final reports.

(A) Chronic toxicity test — Tier 3
- Purpose:
  - Assess long-term toxicity under adverse conditions (cold temperatures, low-quality diet).

- Test conditions:
  - Location: mean monthly low (Dec–Mar) between 20–40°F (−6.6 to 4.4°C).
  - Diet: whole kernel corn (ad libitum), considered nutritionally deficient for ducks.
  - Duration: 60 days exposure after dosing.

- Test materials:
  - Birds: 36 male + 36 female hand-reared mallards, 6–8 months; must resemble wild mallards.
  - Housing: 72 elevated outdoor pens with feeders & waterers.
  - Lab capability: fluoroscopy, blood/tissue assays, necropsies.
  - Shot types: lead (positive control), steel (negative control), candidate shot or coated shot.

- Group design:
  - Total 5 groups:
    - Lead group: 4 ♂ + 4 ♀; dose: one No. 4 lead pellet.
    - Steel group: 8 ♂ + 8 ♀; dose: eight No. 4 steel pellets.
    - Candidate groups (3 groups): each 8 ♂ + 8 ♀; doses: one, four, and eight No. 4 candidate pellets.

- Procedures:
  - Birds assigned to pens first week of December; 2-week acclimation to corn diet.
  - Weekly: weigh and fluoroscope birds; weigh recovered shot to measure erosion.
  - Blood parameters: same as in the 30-day acute toxicity test (defined elsewhere), measured:
    - At 24 hours after dosage.
    - At days 30 and 60.
  - At day 60: sacrifice all survivors.
    - Collect liver and other relevant organs for histopathology.
    - Analyze organs for lead and other metals in the candidate shot/coating.
  - Necropsy all birds that die before day 60 to determine cause/pathology.

- Data analysis:
  - Mortality: chi-square tests among groups.
  - Physiological parameters & tissue contaminants:
    - Use ANOVA or appropriate stats including factors: shot type, dose, sex.
  - Comparison criteria:
    - Effects of candidate shot/coating must be:
      - Significantly less than effects caused by lead shot, and
      - Not significantly greater than effects caused by steel shot.
  - Compare sacrificed vs pre-sacrifice mortalities if sample sizes allow.

(B) Chronic dosage (reproduction) study — Tier 3
- Purpose:
  - Moderately long-term exposure including assessment of reproduction.

- Test materials:
  - Birds: 44 male + 44 female first-year hand-reared mallards; must resemble wild mallards.
  - Housing:
    - Pens for quarantine/acclimation (5–10 ducks per pen).
    - 44 elevated pens with feeders, waterers, nest boxes (for pairs).
  - Lab capability: fluoroscopy, blood/tissue assays, necropsies.
  - Diet: whole kernel corn, commercial duck maintenance mash, commercial breeder mash.
  - Shot types: lead (positive control), steel (negative control), candidate shot/coating.

- Group design:
  - 3 groups:
    - Lead: 4 ♂ + 4 ♀.
    - Steel: 20 ♂ + 20 ♀.
    - Candidate: 20 ♂ + 20 ♀.
  - Held in same-sex groups until mid-January (timing adjusted for region; southern U.S. may require low-temp units).

- Procedures (partial in this excerpt):
  - Acclimation: 3 weeks on commercial maintenance mash.
  - Then 60 days on ad libitum corn.
  - Then pair birds (1 pair/pen) and provide breeder mash.
  - Dosing schedule (day 0 after acclimation, then at 30, 60, 90 days):
    - Lead group: one No. 4 lead pellet per dosing.
    - Steel group: eight No. 4 steel pellets per dosing.
    - Candidate group: eight No. 4 candidate pellets per dosing.
  - Study continues into breeding period (details follow in later text).

Examples embedded in the text
- Use of specific shot loads as controls:
  - 1 pellet lead vs 8 pellets steel (negative control) vs varying doses of candidate shot.
- Environmental stress:
  - Cold outdoor conditions + corn-only diet to simulate adverse wintering conditions.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Positive vs negative controls:
  - Lead shot is the positive (toxic) control; steel shot is the negative (accepted non-toxic) control.
- Dose structure:
  - Toxicity test: 1, 4, 8 pellets for candidate; 1 for lead; 8 for steel.
  - Reproduction study: repeated dosing over time (day 0, 30, 60, 90), but the dose scheme differs (1 pellet for lead, 8 for steel/candidate each time).
- Performance standard:
  - Candidate shot must perform:
    - Better (less toxic) than lead.
    - No worse (no more toxic) than steel, based on mortality and physiological/tissue data.
- Environmental conditions:
  - For southern U.S. tests, cold conditions must be simulated (low-temperature units), not ignored.
