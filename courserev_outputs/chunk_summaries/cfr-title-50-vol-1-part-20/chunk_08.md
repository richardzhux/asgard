    - Facilities may not receive or keep migratory game birds unless birds are tagged as required by §20.36.
  - **§20.82 – Records required**
    - Facilities must maintain accurate records for each bird in custody, showing:
      1. Number of each species  
      2. Location where taken  
      3. Date received  
      4. Name and address of person from whom received  
      5. Date disposed of  
      6. Name and address of person to whom delivered
    - Records must be kept for **1 year** after the last entry; cannot be destroyed earlier.
    - Exception: Hunting clubs that do **not fully process** birds (do not remove both head and wings) are exempt from this recordkeeping.
  - **§20.83 – Inspection of premises**
    - Facilities must allow authorized enforcement personnel to:
      - Enter at reasonable hours  
      - Inspect records and premises

- **Subpart J — Feathers or Skins**
  - **§20.91 – Commercial use of feathers**
    - Permitted: Any person may possess, buy, sell, barter, or transport **feathers of migratory waterfowl** (ducks, geese, brant, swans) killed legally under this part, or seized and condemned by authorities, **for**:
      - Fishing flies  
      - Bed pillows and mattresses  
      - Similar commercial uses
    - Prohibited:
      - Using such feathers for **millinery or ornamental use** in commerce (no buying/selling/bartering for those purposes).
      - Buying/selling/bartering **mounted specimens** of migratory game birds taken under this part.
  - **§20.92 – Personal use of feathers or skins**
    - Any person may, **for personal use**, without a permit:
      - Possess, transport, ship, import, and export feathers and skins of lawfully taken migratory game birds.

- **Subpart K — Annual Seasons, Limits, and Shooting Hours**
  - **§20.100 – General provisions**
    - By default, taking, possessing, transporting, and other uses of migratory game birds by hunters are **prohibited**.
    - They are allowed only when:
      - Regulations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act establish **annual schedules** for:
        - Seasons  
        - Daily bag and possession limits  
        - Shooting (or hawking) hours
    - Migratory game bird populations and habitat conditions vary:
      - Annually, and  
      - By flyway, State, and within States
    - Therefore, **annual adjustments** to these schedules are necessary to keep harvests at permissible levels.

**Definitions / Clarifications**

- **Migratory game birds**: Birds covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and this part (e.g., ducks, geese, brant, swans as waterfowl examples).
- **Migratory bird preservation facility**: A place that receives/holds/processes migratory game birds (e.g., commercial processing plants, taxidermists; hunting clubs only partially processing birds are treated differently for recordkeeping).
- **Fully process (context of §20.82)**: Removal of **both head and wings**; hunting clubs that do not do this are exempt from the recordkeeping rule.

**Examples (Implicit/Explicit)**

- **Feathers allowed for commercial use**:
  - Duck feathers used to make fishing flies sold in a tackle shop.
  - Goose down used in bed pillows and mattresses.
- **Feathers not allowed for certain uses**:
  - Duck feathers sold to make decorative hat plumes (millinery) — prohibited.

**Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

- **Thinking hunting is allowed unless banned**:  
  - The regulation is the opposite: **hunting is prohibited unless** specific annual regulatory schedules open a season with limits and hours.
- **Ignoring State or foreign laws**:
  - Even if federal rules are followed, it is illegal to take/possess/transport birds if **State** or **foreign** law was violated at any point in the chain.
- **Commercial vs personal use of feathers/skins**:
  - Personal use: much broader; may possess, transport, import/export feathers and skins of lawfully taken birds without a permit.
  - Commercial use: tightly restricted; only certain uses (flies, bedding, similar) and **no millinery/ornamental trade or mounted bird sales**.
- **Recordkeeping at facilities**:
  - Facilities must keep detailed records and retain them for at least 1 year after last entry.
  - Hunting clubs might mistakenly think they’re exempt; they are exempt **only if they do not fully process (remove head and wings)**.
- **Package labeling for shipped birds**:
  - Missing species counts or names/addresses on packages imported via mail/carrier violates §20.66 even if the birds themselves were lawfully taken.
