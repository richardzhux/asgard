# Chunk 03 (units 1641-1914)

- **Key Concepts / Sections**
  - **Resistance to crossbreeding in U.S. bulldogs**
    - The Bulldog Club of America (via breeder Ryman) claims its members already breed healthy dogs.
    - They argue there is “no reason” to crossbreed bulldogs with other dogs to improve health.
  - **Ethical concerns about bulldog breeding**
    - Roaldset questions whether it’s ethical to breed dogs in a way that makes them *predisposed to serious illness*.
    - Suggests that improving bulldogs’ quality of life may require changing their physical appearance (less “exaggerated” traits).
  - **Breed standard changes in other countries**
    - **U.K. Kennel Club (French Bulldogs)**:
      - New standards specify visibly open nostrils.
      - Muzzle must be “well-defined” (i.e., not overly flat).
    - **U.K. Kennel Club (Bulldogs, 2009)**:
      - Amended standard: “too many wrinkles” are unacceptable (excessive skin folds are discouraged).
    - **Switzerland – Continental Bulldogs**:
      - A new breed created with a more elongated body to reduce health problems.
  - **Lack of similar reforms in the U.S.**
    - American dog clubs have *not* made comparable changes to bulldog standards.

- **Definitions / Clarifications**
  - **Breed standard**: The official description of how a breed “should” look (structure, size, features) according to a kennel club; influences what breeders select for.
  - **Exaggerated traits**: Extreme physical features (e.g., very flat face, very short muzzle, excess wrinkles) that are visually distinctive but often linked to health issues (breathing problems, skin infections, etc.).

- **Examples**
  - Example of **health-focused standard change**: U.K. rules requiring open nostrils and a defined muzzle for French Bulldogs to improve breathing.
  - Example of **new health-oriented breed**: Continental Bulldogs bred in Switzerland with a longer body to reduce some bulldog-related issues.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**
  - **“Healthy within the standard” vs. actually healthy**:
    - Breeders may claim to breed “healthy” dogs while still adhering to a standard that promotes harmful extremes (e.g., very flat faces).
  - **Appearance vs. welfare**:
    - Confusing the traditional bulldog “look” with what is best for the dog’s health. The text argues better health may require bulldogs to look different.
  - **National differences**:
    - Assuming all kennel clubs react the same way: the U.K. and Switzerland have changed standards/breeds, while American clubs largely have not.
