**Key Concepts / Sections**

1. **Fish Pirate Era & Regulation**
   - **United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries (1873)**
     - Federal agency with **investigative, not regulatory** power.
     - Initial mission: **scientific inquiry** into fisheries.
     - Quickly shifted toward **fish culture**:
       - Running **hatcheries** for valuable species.
       - **Stocking fish** in depleted areas.
   - **States’ Role**
     - **Regulated “takings” and methods**:
       - What could be fished, when, and how (gear types, seasons, etc.).
     - Contrast with federal role: states had **police power**, not just science.

2. **Navigability & Water Use**

   - **Navigability for Access**
     - Defined by **state law**.
     - Determined **regardless of manmade obstructions**:
       - Look at the waterway’s condition **prior to human intervention** or **at time of state admission**.
     - If “navigable,” then:
       - Public often has **rights of access and use** (e.g., boating, fishing).
       - The **riverbed is sovereign property** (held by the state under the **public trust doctrine**).

   - **Public Trust Doctrine**
     - State holds certain resources (like navigable riverbeds) in **trust for the public**.
     - Protects public rights like **navigation, fishing, and access**.
     - Example: **Maryland & the Potomac River**
       - Maryland owns the **entire Potomac River** and manages **oyster bars** (orange areas on map).
       - Yet Maryland **cannot bar Virginia’s (or others’) access** to the river.
       - Reason: principles similar to **federal navigation servitude**—public rights to navigate cannot be blocked.

   - **Human vs. Salmonid Navigability**
     - Reference: **NOAA (2007) map** of waterways used by salmon.
     - Distinction:
       - **Navigable for human access** (boats, recreation, transport).
       - **Accessible for salmonid migration** (fish passage).
     - These categories don’t perfectly overlap; a river might be passable to fish but not boats (or vice versa).

3. **Property Rights Along Water**

   - **Riparian Rights (Rivers/Streams)**
     - Belong to owners of land **along rivers or streams**.
     - Include the right to:
       - Make **reasonable use** of the water.
       - **Fish from their property into the river**, as long as they:
         - Do **not impair** others’ riparian rights.
         - Do not interfere with **public access** where it exists.

   - **Littoral Rights (Lakes/Coasts)**
     - Belong to owners of land **along lakes or seas**.
     - Often involve:
       - Access to the **shoreline**.
       - Use of the **waterfront** (bathing, boating, sometimes wharfing-out).
     - Slide notes a **common-law rule of property ownership for non‑navigable lakes**:
       - Often: property lines extend to the **center of the lake** for each owner.
       - But: **not all states follow this rule**.

**Examples Mentioned**

- **Historical gear & structures**: purse seine, gillnet, dip net, fishing weir, salmon fish traps.
- **Maps & images**:
  - 1904 “Diagram of a Salmon Fish Trap” and 1916 “With the Trap Net Fishermen.”
  - Maps in Wadewitz, *The Nature of Borders*, pp. 56–59.
  - NOAA 2007 map of **salmonid waterways**.
  - Map of **Maryland oyster bars** in the Potomac.

**Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

- **Federal vs. State Power**
  - Federal Commission (1873) ≠ regulator; it studied and propagated fish.
  - **States** primarily regulated **how, when, and what** could be taken.
- **Navigable vs. Non‑navigable**
  - Navigability for **public access** is a **legal** concept, not just physical boatability today.
  - Must consider **historic conditions** (before dams or modifications).
- **Ownership vs. Access**
  - State may **own the riverbed** (sovereign property), but:
    - Cannot always **exclude other states’ citizens or the public** (public trust, navigation servitude).
- **Riparian/Littoral Rights Variability**
  - The illustrated **common‑law approach to non‑navigable lakes** is **not universal**:
    - Different states may define shoreline and bed ownership differently.
  - Private rights (e.g., fishing from your land) are limited by:
    - Other riparian/littoral owners’ rights.
    - Public trust rights where applicable.
