# Chunk 08 (units 5741-6604)

Key concepts / sections
- Statutory interpretation of failed/void bequests
- Effect of residuary clause on failed specific gifts
- Standing to appeal in Orphans’ Court (Pennsylvania)
- Public policy limits on testamentary directions (re destruction of animals)

Definitions / rules
1. Lapsed and void devises/legacies (Wills Act of 1947, §14(9))
   - Applies to devises/bequests **not part of the residuary estate** that:
     - fail or are void because:
       - beneficiary fails to survive the testator, or  
       - contrary to law, or  
       - otherwise incapable of taking effect, or  
       - revoked, undisposed of, released, or disclaimed,  
     - and:
       - do not pass to the beneficiary’s issue under clause (8), and  
       - are not otherwise disposed of by law.  
   - Then: they **fall into the residuary estate** and pass to the residuary beneficiary.

2. Standing to appeal (20 P.S. § 2080.771)
   - Who may appeal from an Orphans’ Court final order:
     - A “party in interest” who is **aggrieved**, or  
     - A fiduciary whose **estate or trust** is aggrieved.  
   - Also permits appeal from a non-final decree of distribution if certified as sufficiently definite.
   - **Key requirement**: the appellant must have a **financial/pecuniary interest** affected by the decree.

3. Executors’ rights and limits
   - Executors here:
     - Are **not distributees**.
     - Have **no pecuniary interest** in the outcome of the dispute.
     - Thus have **no standing to appeal** simply:
       - because they disagree with the order, or  
       - because the court forbids them to carry out certain duties under the will.
   - General principle: Only someone with a **financial interest** may appeal a distribution order of Orphans’ Court (cited: Hunter, Vol. 1, p. 122).

4. Public policy & invalid testamentary provisions
   - Fifth paragraph of will ordering **destruction of two Irish setters** (“Brickland” and “Sunny Birch”) is:
     - **Void** as not within the Wills Act’s purview.
     - **Against public policy** of Pennsylvania.
   - Consequence: the bequest (instruction to destroy) fails; the dogs must be treated as property passing under the will according to statute.

Examples from the case
- Mr. Thomas Miller’s “offer”:
  - He has **no lien** for maintenance of the animals.
  - By agreeing to retain the dogs without claiming maintenance costs (≈ $2,304), he effectively makes an **offer of value** for them.
  - Court says: Accepting this is a **prudent disposition** of the estate’s claim related to the animals.
- Application of §14(9) Wills Act:
  - The failed provision (destruction of the dogs) is a specific bequest that is void.
  - Under §14(9), the dogs pass to the **residuary legatee**: Western Pennsylvania Humane Society.
- Practical resolution:
  - Humane Society (residuary legatee) adopts a resolution to **award custody** of the dogs to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas L. Miller.
  - Court **withholds decree of distribution for 20 days** to allow parties to finalize an agreement consistent with the opinion.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing **moral** or **dutiful** interests with **legal standing**:
  - Executors’ responsibility to carry out the will does **not** give them automatic standing to appeal; they must have a **pecuniary stake**.
- Assuming void instructions (e.g., destruction of property/animals) leave the property ownerless:
  - Under §14(9), failed/void bequests generally **fall into the residuary clause**, not intestacy or abandonment.
- Misreading “party in interest”:
  - It is narrowed by “aggrieved” and by the case law to persons **financially affected**, not just anyone mentioned in the will or involved in administration.
- Thinking a testator can always control the fate of property (including pets) post-death:
  - Testamentary freedom is **limited by public policy**; directions against law or public policy (e.g., unnecessary destruction) will be struck down.
