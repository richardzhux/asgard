# Chunk 09 (units 6561-6604)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - **Temporary custody order**: The court provides for a **20-day period** during which the parties can reach a custody agreement.
  - **Parties involved**:
    - Western Pennsylvania Humane Society  
    - Mr. and Mrs. Thomas L. Miller
  - **Subject matter**: Custody of **two Irish setters**.
  - **Constraint on agreement**: Any agreement must be **“not inconsistent with the opinion filed in this case”**—i.e., the parties’ custody arrangement must comply with the court’s legal and factual determinations.

- **Definitions (contextual)**
  - **Pending agreement**: A short, defined time window (20 days) during which the parties may voluntarily settle the custody issue.
  - **Not inconsistent with the opinion**: The court allows flexibility in how the parties arrange custody, but they cannot contradict the court’s rulings or reasoning.

- **Examples**
  - The case itself serves as an example of:
    - A court allowing the parties a brief negotiation window to decide animal custody.
    - Judicial oversight: even a private agreement (about the dogs) must align with the court’s written opinion.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **Assuming unconditional freedom of agreement**: The parties cannot make *any* arrangement they wish; it must **conform to the court’s opinion**.
  - **Mistaking this for a final, automatic custody decision**: The 20-day period indicates a **temporary, conditional phase**; if no compliant agreement is reached, the court’s opinion will control the outcome.
  - **Overlooking that this concerns animals (the Irish setters), not traditional property or child custody**: The case illustrates how courts may structure custody-like arrangements for animals within estate or related disputes.
