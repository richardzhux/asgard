Key concepts / sections
- Meaning of “dispose” in wills and estates
- Scope of testamentary power under the Wills Act (property disposition vs. destruction)
- Status and treatment of decedent’s dogs as estate property
- Agister’s/kennel keeper’s lien for boarding animals
- Treatment of kennel keeper’s waiver of boarding fees as an “offer” for the animals

Definitions / doctrines
- “Dispose” (in wills context):
  - Dictionary: to distribute, arrange, set in order, settle, determine, bestow for a purpose; synonyms include arrange, order, distribute, adjust, regulate, bestow, give.
  - Case law:
    - Kempinski v. Green: “dispose” = regulate, adjust, or settle.
    - Gordon v. Preston: “dispose of” = to part with.
    - Marrs’ Estate: “dispose” ≈ “settle.”
    - Brown Estate: “disposition” = alienation or bestowal of property; “to dispose of a thing is to direct its subsequent ownership.”
  - Overall in the Wills Act: to direct where property shall go and by whom it shall be enjoyed after death.
  - Critically: no authority enlarges “dispose” to include “destroy.”

- Testamentary power under the Wills Act:
  - A will is a statutory right, not a natural right.
  - The Wills Act gives power to direct post‑death ownership and enjoyment of property.
  - It does not confer a power to order destruction of property (including animals) after death.

- Agister’s lien / kennel keeper’s lien:
  - At common law, agisters (those who board animals) had no lien for care and keep:
    - They did not fall under lien rules for:
      - Those who add value to a chattel by labor/skill; or
      - Innkeepers (who have special duties to guests).
  - Liens for animal boarding are purely statutory; existence and scope depend on express statutory language.
  - In this case: no applicable statute → no lien for the kennel keeper.

Key applications / examples
- Destruction clause for pets:
  - Testatrix attempted to direct that her two Irish setters be destroyed after her death.
  - Court held this is beyond her power under the Wills Act because “dispose” does not include “destroy.”
  - Result: the dogs (Brickland and Sunny Birch) must be treated as estate property to be disposed of (transferred), not destroyed.

- Valuation and transfer of decedent’s dogs:
  - Dogs boarded with kennel keeper (Thomas L. Miller) for ~98 weeks at $24/week ≈ $2,352 (text also approximates ~$2,500 / $2,304).
  - Miller offers to waive his entire claim for boarding costs in exchange for ownership of the dogs.
  - Since he has no statutory lien, he has only a claim against the estate; his waiver is equivalent to an offer to “pay” that amount for the dogs.
  - Court views acceptance of this offer as a prudent disposition of a claim against the estate (i.e., beneficial to the estate: avoids paying boarding fees and provides a home for the animals).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing “dispose” with “destroy”:
  - “Dispose” in testamentary statutes means directing future ownership, not physical destruction of property.
  - A testator cannot use a will to mandate destruction of property (including pets), unless some specific law allowed it (and here, it does not).

- Assuming a common‑law lien for boarding animals:
  - There is no automatic common‑law lien for agisters; such liens exist only if created by statute.
  - Without a statute, a kennel keeper has only a contractual/quantum meruit claim against the estate, not a possessory lien.

- Overlooking the estate’s duty to maximize value:
  - Estate must treat the animals as assets and handle them prudently (e.g., taking the best available “offer,” here the waiver of a substantial boarding claim).
