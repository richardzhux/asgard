# Chunk 16 (units 12301-13200)

Key concepts / sections
- Cannery practices and waste
- “Fish pirates” and theft from traps
- Legal definition of property in wild fish
- Criminalization of fish larceny
- Early 20th‑century regulation and border policing (start of Chapter 6)

Definitions / core ideas
- Fish offal:  
  Waste from fish processing (heads, guts, trimmings). Sources note large quantities and concerns about disposal.

- “Fish pirates”:  
  Contemporary term for people who stole salmon from commercial gear—especially traps or nets—rather than catching fish independently.

- Property in wild animals / fish:
  - Pierson v. Post (NY, 1805): Established that property in wild animals (ferae naturae) is acquired by possession, not just pursuit.
  - State of Ohio v. Shaw et al. (Ohio Supreme Court, 1902): Applied property principles to fish in nets/traps. Fish caught in a trap were treated as the property of the trap owner, making taking them larceny.
  - Later federal cases (Miller v. U.S., 1917; Klemm v. U.S., 1927): Upheld that stealing fish from traps is a federal crime (larceny).

- Regulatory framework:
  - Washington State Session Laws (1915), chap. 31, §§63–64: Codified criminal penalties for stealing fish from traps/gear (fish larceny).
  - Early Washington regulations (not fully quoted here) required fishing licenses and restricted them to state citizens—an early tool for border and resource control.

Examples
- Cannery waste and community use:
  - Some evidence that Pacific American Fisheries (PAF) allowed local residents to take fish that were about to spoil (e.g., “Free Salmon at Pacific American Fisheries” photograph), though frequency is unclear.
  - At the same time, sources note substantial waste (offal) and dumping.

- Fish pirates in the press:
  - “Salmon Men Fear Work of Fish Pirates” (Bellingham Reveille, 1911) and “Pirates vs. Fish Trap” (Anacortes American, 1902) show canners’ and trap owners’ alarm about theft.
  - Newspaper items like “Decidedly Too Many Fish” suggest gluts that might have encouraged both waste and petty theft.

- Court cases and trials:
  - Local trials over fish theft from traps are recalled in oral histories (Scott, Vogt, etc.) and newspapers; they illustrate how ambiguous norms became framed as criminal acts once law and precedent hardened.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Morality vs. legality:
  - Before key court decisions and statutes, it was not always legally clear whether taking fish from a trap was theft; later sources retroactively treat all such acts as clearly “piracy.”
  - Community norms (seeing traps as monopolistic and unfair) could conflict with formal law that defined trap‑caught fish as private property.

- Evidence limits:
  - The Aiston Collection uses an idiosyncratic coding system; some citations are hard to interpret, reminding you that detailed quantitative claims about frequency of piracy or free‑fish distribution may be uncertain.

- “Too many fish” vs. scarcity:
  - Press claims of “too many fish” (gluts, low prices) coexist with long‑term concerns about overfishing. Don’t conflate short‑term market gluts with ecological abundance.
