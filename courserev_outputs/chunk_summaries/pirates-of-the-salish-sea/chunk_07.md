# Chunk 07 (units 4921-5820)

Key concepts / sections
- Corporate control of trap locations
- Fishermen’s responses to traps (conflict between gear types)
- Gender, labor, and “manhood” in fishing
- Age, economic pressure, and collusion with pirates
- Corporate lawbreaking as pirates’ moral justification

Definitions / key ideas
- Dummy traps: Legally licensed traps that might catch a few fish but were mainly used to occupy space and block competitors, not to maximize catch.
- Corking a trap: Fishing directly in front of a trap with mobile gear (e.g., gill net) to intercept salmon before they enter the trap.
- Set gill net licenses: Cheaper licenses that some trap owners bought not to fish with gill nets, but to legally claim even more shoreline/trap locations at lower cost.
- Watchmen: Employees stationed at traps to guard them and (sometimes) secretly fish them during closed periods.

Examples / details
- Spatial monopoly tactics:
  - Big packers maintained “real,” “experimental,” and “dummy” traps to occupy much of the productive coastline and exclude mobile fishermen from entire areas.
  - Packagers openly described some traps as existing only to “protect” others.
  - They also bought set gill net licenses to lay claim to potential trap sites, saving money compared to buying full trap licenses.

- Conflict and resistance:
  - 1905: Some fishers in Washington used gill nets to “cork” traps, blocking fish from entering.
  - Washington Fish Commissioner Kershaw deputized purse seiners (unpaid) to police traps during weekly closed periods, intensifying gear-based divisions.
  - Fish pirates sometimes rammed traps with their boats, causing damage and signaling hostility toward both the technology and its corporate owners.

- Masculinity and labor:
  - Traps reduced the number of fishermen needed; owners became “largely independent of other fishermen.”
  - Many jobs were rendered obsolete; trap fishing was perceived as less “real” or less masculine than gillnetting or seining.
  - Displaced white fishermen risked being pushed into cannery work alongside Asian men, Native women, and more white women—seen by some as a loss of masculine status, feeding resentment and rationalizations for piracy.

- Age and economic necessity:
  - The Pacific American Fisheries (PAF) company suspected older watchmen were more likely to cooperate with pirates.
  - PAF responded by pairing older watchmen with younger new hires, at substantial extra cost, because they believed “old‑time watchmen sell us out very often.”
  - Older men:
    - More likely to have been displaced from fishing by traps.
    - More likely to have union or labor-movement sympathies.
    - Had heavier financial responsibilities (family, rent, debts).

- Corporate illegality and pirate ethics:
  - Trap owners sometimes secretly fished during legally mandated weekly closed times, paying watchmen extra for this illegal work.
  - Former pirate Bert Jones: admitted being a “crook” but argued trap owners were equally crooked because they fished during closed season.
  - Complaint: a trap catching 60,000 fish on one tide was accepted, but a small independent catch (e.g., 2,000 fish) was criminalized as “piracy.”
  - Some pirates believed that because corporate trap owners violated conservation laws, they deserved to be robbed.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Seeing piracy as purely criminal/individual:
  - The text insists on structural causes: monopolistic spatial control, labor displacement, class resentment, and perceived gendered loss of status.
- Assuming only “outsiders” were pirates:
  - Older employees of trap companies themselves may have colluded with pirates due to displacement and financial pressure.
- Assuming corporate actors were law-abiding:
  - Trap owners also violated conservation rules, blurring the moral line between “pirates” and “legitimate” operators.
