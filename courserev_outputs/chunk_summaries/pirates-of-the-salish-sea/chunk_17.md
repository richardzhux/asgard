# Chunk 17 (units 13121-13450)

Key concepts / sections
- Expansion of fisheries regulation (Washington State, late 19th–early 20th c.)
- Licensing and citizenship restrictions
- Enforcement capacity and funding
- Cross-border / international aspects (U.S.–Canada coordination)
- Use of archival sources and oral histories

Definitions / core ideas
- State Fish Commissioner: Washington State official/agency responsible for managing, reporting on, and enforcing regulations in fisheries (e.g., Annual Reports cited).
- Fishing licenses restricted to state citizens: Legal rule limiting commercial fishing rights to citizens/residents of the state, often excluding non-citizen and non-resident fishers.
- Enforcement vessels (“patrol boats”):
  - Boats funded and operated by the Fish Commissioner to patrol fishing grounds and enforce regulations.
  - Kershaw requested legislative funds to run more patrol boats (1902 report).

Examples from text
- Regulatory developments:
  - 1891 First Annual Report: early overview of salmon fishery regulation and needs.
  - 1893 Attorney General’s report: clarifies legality of requiring licenses and restricting them to state citizens.
  - 1890s–early 1900s: additional laws codified (e.g., Austin’s compilation; Little’s Fish and Game Laws).
- Enforcement practice:
  - 1902 Thirteenth Annual Report: quotes showing concern over illegal fishing and need for patrol boats.
  - Kershaw’s request for more funds to operate enforcement boats.
  - 1913 Washington State Fisheries report sent to B.C. Premier Richard McBride: evidence of cross-border concern over fisheries.
- Sources and methods:
  - Archival government records (RG 36, RG 23, GR-0435, etc.).
  - Oral history interview (Walter Scott, “Early Fishing Days/Working the Fish Traps and Remembrances”) used to reconstruct lived experience of trap fishing and enforcement.
  - Chang’s work on U.S. and Canadian Immigration Bureaus suggests inter-agency, cross-border dimensions to fisheries and labor control (though the sentence is cut off here).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Don’t treat these citations as just “background noise”: they show how fisheries regulation grew more complex, more exclusionary (citizenship-based), and more aggressively enforced by 1900–1915.
- “State citizens” vs federal citizenship: the restriction is at state-law level; it may overlap but is not identical to federal immigration/nationality categories.
- Enforcement capacity was not automatic:
  - Laws existed on paper, but agencies repeatedly asked legislatures for more funds and boats to enforce them.
  - Oral histories can highlight gaps between law and practice.
- Cross-border context:
  - Fisheries regulation in Washington can’t be fully understood without noting Canadian and U.S. federal actors (Immigration Bureaus, B.C. Department of Fisheries) and their shared marine space (Salish Sea).
