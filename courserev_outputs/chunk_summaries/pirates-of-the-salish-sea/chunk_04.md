# Chunk 04 (units 2461-3360)

Key concepts / sections
- Increasing violence in fish piracy (early 1900s)
- Economics of fish piracy vs legal fishing
- Channels for selling stolen fish
- Who became fish pirates (social/ethnic background, occupations)

Definitions / key ideas
- Fish piracy / fish rustling: Illegal taking of fish from traps and/or illegal fishing in restricted/border waters, often involving theft from cannery-owned gear.
- Trap watchman: Employee assigned to guard fish traps and their catch from thieves; sometimes colluded with pirates.

Examples / details
- Violent confrontations:
  - 1911: American pirates “with guns blazing” raided Canadian traps in Strait of Juan de Fuca; a trap watchman’s hat was shot off.
  - 1912: Canadian trap watchman opened fire on fish pirates; pirates replied with shotguns and rifles.
  - 1917: Trap watchman’s dead body found in a trap spill on Whidbey Island; authorities suspected fish pirates.
  - Local anecdote (1910s): Cannery owner’s son shot and killed a poacher stealing low‑value chum/dog salmon—shows extreme frustration and tension despite low commercial value.

- Economic drivers and profits:
  - Pirating increased when fish prices were high; “price of fish this year proved too great a temptation.”
  - Advantages over legal fishing:
    - Traps were extremely efficient: thousands of fish at a time, decks nearly underwater.
    - Pirated fish could be landed fresh in one large, uniform batch—attractive to buyers.
    - Regular fishermen had to pay canners for boat, gear, and sometimes food; pirates often did not bear those costs.
  - Bert Jones:
    - Typical haul ~2,500 fish per night.
    - Income per load: ~$600–$1,800 depending on species and market (for one night’s work).
    - Used income to build a house, travel; claimed in 1978 he still had >$20,000 saved from pirating.
  - Walter Scott:
    - Sold routinely to a cannery tender that cruised boundary waters specifically to buy fish (including stolen fish).
    - Knew a Norwegian trap watchman who denied theft but, after being fired, bought a farm for cash—suggesting illicit income.
  - Elmer Vogt:
    - Suspected a worker of selling fish to pirates; worker spent ~$2,000 more than his season’s wages.
    - Observed pirate Red Custer: pirated 3 months/year and lived comfortably the rest of the year.

- Market and buyers:
  - Cannery tenders actively bought fish in boundary waters, likely knowing some were pirated.
  - Pirates capitalized on demand for large, fresh deliveries without the capital costs of gear or boats.

- Who were the pirates?
  - Names/nicknames: Spider Jones, Red Custer, Cowboy Terry, Speckled Harry (“Terror of the Gulf”), Walter Scott, Bert Jones.
  - Ambiguous backgrounds:
    - Records mention a pirate described as very intelligent from a “highly respected family.”
    - Some were disgruntled commercial fishermen (e.g., purse seiners in SE Alaska).
    - Many alternated between wage work in the fishing industry and more lucrative pirating.
    - Some Native fish pirates existed, but most appear to have been of European / Euro‑American descent.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Value of species: Even low‑value species like chum could provoke deadly confrontations—not because of fish value alone but due to accumulated resentment, property defense, and law/order issues.
- “Pirate” identity: Pirates were often not full‑time outlaws; many moved in and out of legal work in the same industry, and some came from respectable or stable backgrounds.
- Legality vs morality: Buyers (e.g., tenders, canneries) could profit from piracy while maintaining a veneer of legality; the system involved both thieves and complicit legal actors.
