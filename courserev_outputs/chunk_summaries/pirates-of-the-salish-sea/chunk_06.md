# Chunk 06 (units 4101-5000)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Selective fish piracy**
    - Fish pirates mostly targeted salmon traps owned by **large canning corporations** (PAF, Fidalgo, Bellingham Canning Company), not small operators.
    - Justification/attitude: stealing from big firms “evened the odds” against corporate monopolies and wage labor in what was seen as a common resource.
    - Former trap operator Elmer Vogt: pirates **bypassed small operations**; his watchmen usually refused bribes.
    - Some pirates preferred to sell stolen fish to **smaller, independent canneries**, who needed fish and would pay high prices.

  - **Personalized conflict**
    - Example: Big cannery boss **Bill Lowman** believed pirate **“Spider Jones”** singled out his traps more than others’.
    - Lowman had especially **valuable trap locations**, increasing both his profits and the incentive for pirates.

  - **Trap sites, monopolization, and corporate conflict**
    - By **1909**, Washington had issued **525 fish trap licenses**, collectively worth **> $1 million**.
    - Big canneries fought hard for **best trap locations**, often just taken from Indigenous fishing sites.
    - Corporations fought:
      - 1896: **Fidalgo Island Packing Co.** vs **APA** and a B.C. company over Fidalgo’s trap sites.
      - ~1906: **Capitol City Canning & Packing (Victoria)** sued **ABC Packing** over a Canadian leased trap site.
    - **Independent fishermen** occasionally tried to contest corporate trap sites but **rarely won**.

  - **Spatial impact of traps on other fisheries**
    - Before regulation, companies sometimes **linked multiple traps** to form de facto **blockades**.
      - Example: 3 traps at **Point Roberts** linked to extend **1 mile** into coastal waters.
    - These practices interfered with **seiners and gillnetters**, prompting protests.

  - **Regulation of fish traps (Washington State, 1897)**
    - Aim: **conservation** and reduction of complete blockades.
    - Rules:
      - Trap mouths **≥ 600 feet apart**.
      - Traps required **≥ 2400 lateral feet between them**.
      - **Leads** (webbing walls guiding fish into traps) **≤ 2500 feet** long.
    - Idea: leave pathways so some salmon could bypass traps and reach spawning grounds.

  - **Strategic use of “experimental” and “dummy” traps**
    - **Experimental traps**:
      - Used to **test new locations**.
      - Might or might not be actively fished in a given year, depending on productivity.
    - **Dummy traps**:
      - Caught some fish, but primary purpose was **defensive**:
        - Occupy legal space so competitors couldn’t place their traps or fish nearby.
    - Together with active traps, these installations could **exclude mobile fishermen** (with gear like seines and gillnets) from entire productive areas.
    - Big packers openly admitted they maintained some traps **just “to protect” other traps**, i.e., to **defend spatial monopolies**, not simply to catch fish.

- **Definitions**

  - **Fish piracy**: Illegal taking of fish from others’ traps, often by independent fishermen, sometimes justified as resistance to corporate monopolies.
  - **Trap**: A fixed fishing installation with a **lead** (long fence of netting) that funnels salmon into a holding area.
  - **Lead**: The long wall of netting that directs fish toward the trap’s interior.
  - **Trap “jumping”**: Attempting to occupy or claim another party’s established trap site.
  - **Experimental trap**: A trap set to test potential new locations; may not be fished every season.
  - **Dummy trap**: A minimally or nonproductive trap maintained mainly to **block competitors** from using adjacent space.

- **Examples to remember**

  - **Spider Jones vs. Bill Lowman**: Illustrates how piracy could become personalized and target especially profitable corporate sites.
  - **Fidalgo Island Packing vs. APA and B.C. company (1896)**: Corporate litigation over trap locations in Washington.
  - **Capitol City vs. ABC Packing (c. 1900s)**: Similar trap-site conflict on the Canadian side.
  - **Point Roberts (1895)**: Discovery of 3 linked traps forming a mile-long barrier; a key trigger for later trap regulations.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - Misconception: Fish pirates attacked all traps equally.
    - In reality, they **focused on big corporate traps** and often spared small local operators.
  - Misunderstanding the purpose of regulations:
    - Laws were **framed as conservation** but were **manipulated** by large canneries (via dummy/experimental traps) to **maintain spatial control**.
  - Assuming trap licensing ended conflicts:
    - Even with licenses and spacing rules, **legal fights and spatial competition** remained intense among corporations and between corporations and independent fishermen.
