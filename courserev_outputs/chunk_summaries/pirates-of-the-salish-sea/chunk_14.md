# Chunk 14 (units 10661-11560)

Key concepts / sections
- Economic stakes of “fish piracy”
- Scale of individual fishermen’s catches and earnings
- Who the pirates were (local vs outsiders)
- Cross-border dimension of gear and fish theft (B.C.–Washington)
- Reliability and limits of oral histories vs archival sources

Definitions / core ideas
- Fish pirates: People who stole fish or fishing gear (e.g., from traps, canneries, scows) on the Salish Sea; distinct from licensed commercial fishers.
- Gear theft: Stealing boats, nets, or other fishing equipment, sometimes moving it across the U.S.–Canada border.

Key details and examples
- Value of stolen catches  
  - One 1908 robbery: about 5,000 salmon stolen, worth over $2,000.
- Typical legal catch vs. pay  
  - Some fishermen claimed daily catches of 1,500–3,000 fish.  
  - Sockeye often sold for $0.10–$0.25 each.  
  - At only $0.10 each, that’s $150–$300 per day in gross value.  
  - Due to debts/obligations to canners, fishermen sometimes ended the entire season with only about $150 net.
- Who were the pirates?  
  - Oral histories sometimes recall only a few local pirates, or name specific individuals.  
  - One informant (Bert Jones) inconsistently claimed to be the only local fish pirate while also saying “many people” did it—showing memory limits and ambiguity.  
  - Newspapers and officials referred to “fish pirates” from various locales (e.g., “from Fraser,” “on the Sound,” “harbor pirates at Port Townsend”).
- Cross-border activity  
  - Records show B.C. gear recovered in the United States on multiple occasions.  
  - Some Americans went north to fish (and sometimes pirate) in Canadian waters.  
  - Authorities on both sides tracked stolen gear and cross-border offenders.
- Official concern and enforcement  
  - Provincial and federal officials (B.C. Department of Fisheries, Provincial Police, U.S. Customs Service, Marine and Fisheries) corresponded frequently about piracy, boat theft, and trap raids.  
  - Canners’ and fishermen’s associations kept minutes that record gear losses, recoveries, and complaints about enforcement.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Overestimating or underestimating piracy:
  - Oral histories may minimize piracy (“only a few pirates”) or exaggerate it (“everyone did it”); archival sources suggest a real but uneven problem.
- Confusing gross catch value with fishermen’s income:
  - Big daily catches did not translate directly into high earnings because of canner control, credit/debt, and settlement at season’s end.
- Blurred national lines:
  - It’s easy to assume piracy was mostly one-way (e.g., Americans stealing from Canadians), but records show gear and people moving in both directions across the border.
