# Chunk 03 (units 1641-2540)

Key concepts / sections
- Low wages and corruption among trap watchmen  
- Bribery as a routine part of fish pirating  
- Communication systems (coded phone calls) used by pirates  
- Technological change: small gas engines and mobility  
- Escalating violence between trap watchmen and pirates  

Definitions / ideas
- Trap watchmen: Employees hired by trap owners/canneries to guard stationary fish traps from theft.
- Fish pirates: Poachers who stole fish from commercial traps, often at night and often with some local cooperation.

Details & examples
1. Low pay → willingness to collude
   - Trap owners resisted paying watchmen enough to ensure loyalty; described as not caring about their employees’ ability to protect company interests.
   - Example (Elmer Vogt): In the 1910s, Bellingham Canning Co. watchman accepted $500 from American fish pirates for ~10,000 fish and even helped load the boat; $500 > his remaining season’s wages.
   - Bert Jones: Typically paid watchmen $100–$700 per load; carried “lots of money” for that purpose.
   - Perception among watchmen: fish were “made for everybody” and they were entitled to a cut.

2. Norms around paying watchmen
   - Walter Scott claimed it was bad form *not* to pay watchmen; said the only free fish taken were small “dips” requested from the watchman for gas/food.
   - Author notes this was *not* a universal rule; some pirates did not follow such informal ethical norms.

3. Coded communication
   - Pirates used phone calls with agreed-upon phrases to identify traps ready for theft.
   - Example code (Bert Jones): Caller said “My engine’s broke down… come and help me tow it in” = come get fish at that location; caller later received ~$100.
   - Less subtle messages also used, e.g., “Come up to Lummi. Come north to the high peak,” literally directing pirates.
   - Purpose (per W.J. Beale): evade government phone taps, though records show authorities rarely used such advanced surveillance in practice.

4. Technological innovations
   - Widespread adoption of small internal combustion engines after 1900:
     - By 1913, >80% of Fraser River gillnetters motorized.
     - Canneries’ tenders and purse seiners also adopted gas engines.
   - Effects:
     - Legitimate fishers could work farther from canneries and in new areas.
     - Pirates gained speed and range; engines allowed them to outrun larger patrol vessels.
   - Some pirates initially used small sailing sloops for quiet and low cost, but many shifted to powered boats.
   - By early 20th century, ideal pirate vessel: enough hold space for a profitable load + engine powerful enough to evade patrols.

5. Escalating violence
   - Some pirates (e.g., Bert Jones) avoided force; Jones fired an assistant for shooting at a watchman and claimed he’d never killed for fish.
   - Trap owners/canneries armed watchmen and ordered “shoot-on-sight” policies.
     - Anacortes American acknowledged the harshness but endorsed it as “effective.”
   - Examples of violent encounters:
     - 1903: Pirates shot out windows of a watchman’s quarters on an Alaska Packers’ Association (APA) trap near Point Roberts.
     - 1908: Pirates boarded another APA trap; disarmed the watchman when he reached for his gun, then gagged and bound him.
     - 1911: Secretary of Fraser River Canners’ Association reported American pirates, “guns blazing,” raiding Canadian traps in Strait of Juan de Fuca; only casualty was a trap watchman’s hat.
   - Pattern: retaliation and arming on both sides led to more frequent threats and shootings across the border.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming watchmen were always loyal: Low wages and informal norms meant many cooperated with pirates for cash.
- Overestimating state surveillance: Oral traditions stressed coded calls to avoid phone taps, but official records show such surveillance was rare.
- Thinking pirates were uniformly ruthless: Some, like Jones, actively avoided violence; others freely used guns and intimidation.
- Believing there was a single pirate “code” of conduct: Norms like always paying watchmen were not universal across the pirating community.
