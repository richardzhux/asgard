# Chunk 02 (units 821-1720)

Key concepts / sections
- Fish pirates’ skills and tactics
- Cross-border (US–Canada) dimensions of fish piracy
- Economic incentives and markets for stolen salmon
- Role of trap watchmen (security) and corruption/bribery

Definitions / key terms
- Fish pirates / trap rustlers: Fishermen who illegally stole salmon from fish traps (and sometimes boats, nets, docked fish) in the Salish Sea, especially early 1900s.
- Fish traps: Fixed gear used by canneries to intercept migrating salmon; highly valuable because they could capture large quantities of fish.
- Boundary waters: Waters around the Canada–US border (e.g., Boundary Bay, near Point Roberts) where jurisdiction was contested and enforcement harder.

Key points & examples

1. Skills and methods of fish pirates
- Former cannery fishermen (e.g., Jones) used:
  - Detailed local knowledge of the Salish Sea’s “intricate waterscape.”
  - Navigation without lights at night to avoid detection.
  - Natural cues (e.g., following cormorants “skags” to reefs and traps).
- Revenue cutters and patrols struggled to catch them because:
  - Pirates tracked (“kept tabs on”) government vessels.
  - Geography and darkness favored locals with intimate knowledge of channels and reefs.
- Stolen fish were hard to trace:
  - Owners could see their traps had been robbed but couldn’t prove which fish in the market came from their traps.
  - Joke in paper: if thieves weren’t caught in the act, owners had to pretend “the fish forgot to run the night before.”

2. Expansion and targets of piracy
- After 1900, fish poaching became more frequent and diversified:
  - Beyond trap-stealing: pirates also stole nets, boats, and fish from cannery docks.
- Pirates crossed the US–Canada border:
  - Chose which side to steal from and where to sell based on prices and patrol presence.
  - Washington had more traps, so more rustling there, but Canadian traps were hit when profitable.
- Examples:
  - 1905: Canadian traps (Findlay, Durham & Brodie) lost ~30,000 fish; initially called an “accident,” later identified as “serious criminal action.”
  - 1909: B.C. packers in Boundary Bay believed their traps were “robbed blind”; requested police action on “Depredation of Marauders on both sides of the line.”
  - American canners nearby denied seeing anything—possibly because they bought the stolen fish.

3. Cross-border dynamics and blame
- Pirates exploited:
  - Jurisdictional gaps between Canadian and American authorities.
  - Economic differences: fewer traps in B.C. meant demand (and prices) were often higher there.
- 1909 incident:
  - American canners claimed 40 armed Canadian poachers raided traps near Boundary Bay and fled into Canadian waters.
  - They responded by hiring more armed watchmen.
  - Newspapers fueled US–Canada rivalry by blaming “Canadian pirates.”
  - Later, authorities found the culprits were actually American.
- 1911–1912:
  - Thefts from the few Canadian traps on Vancouver Island’s west coast; some boats identified as American-owned (from Seattle).
- 1912 chase:
  - Canadian patrol pursued an American vessel trying to cross into US waters.
  - Rustler taunted that they could only board in Neah Bay (US jurisdiction).
  - Patrol rammed and rolled the slower boat before it could reach the border and seized it.

4. Trap watchmen and corruption
- Many pirates didn’t just sneak in; they got help from trap watchmen:
  - Some watchmen signaled with lights to guide rustlers at night.
  - Most accepted bribes; cooperation sometimes free, but often paid.
- Low wages as a cause:
  - Walter Scott (former fish pirate) criticized trap owners for underpaying watchmen so badly they “didn’t give a damn” about owners’ interests.
  - Seasoned fisherman Elmer Vogt agreed poor pay incentivized watchmen to accept bribes.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Accidents” vs. deliberate theft:
  - Early on, some large losses were framed as accidents until evidence or scale made piracy obvious.
- National blame:
  - Both sides often blamed “foreign” pirates; actual perpetrators were sometimes from their own country.
- Legibility of stolen fish:
  - There was no way to visually identify “stolen” fish in the market; enforcement depended on catching pirates in the act, not on tracing product.
