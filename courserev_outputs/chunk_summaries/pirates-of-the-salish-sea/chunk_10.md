# Chunk 10 (units 7381-8280)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Overproduction and Waste in the Salmon Fishery**
    - Fish traps (often catching 10,000–20,000 fish at a time), purse seines, and gill nets produced more salmon than canneries could process.
    - Chronic reports (1870s–early 1900s) of:
      - Rivers “alive with dead fish” (Fraser River).
      - Hundreds of dead salmon floating in the Fraser.
      - ~9 million pounds of fish offal per season (1892 study), much of it still edible.
    - 1901: canneries on both sides of the border filled all available cans but still **threw away more salmon than they used**.
    - Eyewitness examples:
      - Scowloads of salmon brought in, then scowloads dumped back out because they spoiled.
      - One person saw 80,000 fish on a single scow, all shoveled overboard: “Tons and tons of sockeye just went to the bottom.”

  - **Shared Responsibility for Waste and Overfishing**
    - **Trap operators** could, in theory, regulate how many fish they took (by how they emptied traps), but did not consistently do so.
    - **Fish pirates**:
      - Stole fish from traps to sell (profit motive).
      - Likely increased oversupply at canneries by bringing in additional fish beyond planned trap–cannery balances.
    - **Cannery operators**:
      - Accepted huge volumes they couldn’t process.
      - Lacked sufficient labor; often dumped spoiled fish.
    - **Fishermen with efficient gear**:
      - Expanded efforts “farther from shore and out onto the high seas,” intensifying pressure on salmon stocks.
    - Result: **few incentives** to follow regulations or conserve salmon, and most participants did not.

  - **Fish Pirates’ Self-Image vs. Reality**
    - Pirates tried to present themselves as the **opposite of trap owners** (as if resisting monopoly/greed).
    - In reality they:
      - Fished “irresponsibly” and added to waste.
      - Created extra problems for fishery regulators.
    - They relied on **local solidarity** (community support or silence) to avoid arrest and criticism.

  - **Canners Fight Back**
    - Trap owners and canners were angered by fish theft:
      - PAF superintendent Bert Huntoon (1903) reported nightly pirate visits; pirates openly telling watchmen they would return and “divide” the catch or take it anyway.
      - 1911: Bellingham Reveille reported cannery operators were quietly but actively trying to **stop financial losses due to pirating**.
      - Anecdote: PAF president E. B. Deming confronted pirate Red Custer, saying: “I know you are stealing my fish, but it wouldn’t be so bad if you’d sell them to me and at least let me can them.”
    - **Anti-piracy measures**:
      - Canadian canners called on the **Dominion Department of Marine and Fisheries (DMF)** and local police to increase patrols on the Fraser and boundary waters during heavy depredations.
      - Because piracy was worse in U.S. waters, **northern Puget Sound packers** (e.g., PAF) were more aggressive and proactive.
      - Trade press (Pacific Fisherman) framed it as a campaign where **invention, courage, law, and guards** would eventually suppress fish piracy.

- **Definitions / roles**

  - **Fish trap**: Stationary gear that intercepts migrating salmon; capable of enormous catches, contributing to overharvest and waste when not regulated to match cannery capacity.
  - **Fish pirate**: Poacher who steals fish from traps or violates fishing regulations, usually to sell to buyers; in this context often celebrated locally but functionally part of the overfishing problem.
  - **Offal**: Waste parts from processed fish (heads, guts, etc.); here, used broadly to include discarded but still-edible fish flesh.

- **Examples (embedded in text)**

  - Oversupply: “Scowload after scowload” of salmon brought to canneries, then dumped due to spoilage.
  - Extreme waste event: 80,000 sockeye on one scow, all shoveled overboard.
  - Pirate behavior: Pirates openly visiting traps nightly, offering watchmen a cut, and insisting they would take the fish “one way or another.”
  - Corporate response: Deming’s sidewalk confrontation with pirate Red Custer.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **Myth: Pirates as conservationists or folk heroes.**
    - Reality: They **increased** pressure on salmon runs and added to waste by destabilizing any trap–cannery coordination.
  
  - **Myth: Only trap owners or canneries to blame for depletion.**
    - Text emphasizes **system-wide responsibility**:
      - Trap owners, pirates, independent fishermen, and canneries all contributed.
  
  - **Confusion between regulation and practice.**
    - Regulations existed, but with **weak incentives** and strong profit motives, compliance was low, and enforcement was difficult—especially against pirates protected by local solidarity.
