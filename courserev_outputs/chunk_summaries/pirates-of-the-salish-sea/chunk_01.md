# Chunk 01 (units 1-900)

Key concepts / sections
- Emergence of fish piracy in the Salish Sea
- Progressive Era conservation and regulation
- Economic and spatial power of fish traps
- Conflicts over “common property” resources
- Example: Bert “Spider” Jones and daily life of a fish pirate

Definitions / main ideas
- Fish piracy (in this context):
  - Illegal taking of salmon from commercial fish traps and possibly other restricted locations.
  - Often carried out by small-boat fishermen using local knowledge to evade patrols.

- Fish traps:
  - Large, fixed structures placed in coastal waters to intercept migrating salmon.
  - Very expensive to build (about $5,000 initially; some later sold for $20,000–$90,000 each in the late 1890s).
  - Extremely efficient: one Fidalgo Island Packing Company trap took nearly 200,000 fish in 1898, mostly sockeye.
  - Occupied substantial stretches of sea space, often at former Indigenous reef net sites.

- Progressive Era conservation:
  - Early 20th‑century movement emphasizing scientific management and regulation of natural resources.
  - Laws restricted how and when people could harvest resources, in the name of conservation and efficiency.
  - Dominated by upper-/middle‑class, white, native‑born, largely Protestant ideas about “proper” use of nature.

- Common property doctrine (Euro-American/Euro-Canadian):
  - Fish defined as a common property resource (no one owns them until captured).
  - Fish pirates invoked this to argue that traps and canners were unfairly privatizing a common resource.

Key examples
- Bert “Spider” Jones:
  - Operated at night from towns like Anacortes, Blaine, Friday Harbor, Steveston, Tsawwassen.
  - Avoided government patrols by:
    - Hiding during the day, working at night.
    - Running dark (lights and engines off), paddling quietly.
    - Using fog cover and careful observation to ensure he was alone.
  - Located rich traps by following cormorants and knowledge of trap locations (often on old Indigenous reef-net sites).
  - Testimony: “Every night I used to get a load of fish.”

- Fidalgo Island trap example:
  - One of 21 traps caught ~200,000 fish in 1898, mostly high‑value sockeye, illustrating how traps reduced need for individual fishermen.

Arguments / positions
- Trap owners / canners:
  - Used conservation rhetoric and law to justify exclusive, capital-intensive gear.
  - Gained control over both salmon and access to key fishing space.
  - Benefited from state-backed regulations that favored large capital over small fishermen and local practices.

- Fish pirates:
  - Claimed traps and canners were the real lawbreakers and wasters of fish.
  - Framed their own poaching as reclaiming common resources for the broader community.
  - Exploited the cross-border (U.S.–Canada) nature of the Salish Sea to evade enforcement.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Don’t assume “conservation” policies were neutral:
  - They often reinforced class and racial hierarchies and displaced Indigenous and small-scale fishers.
- Don’t confuse fish pirates with purely self-interested thieves:
  - They were also reacting to loss of access, exclusion by capital-intensive traps, and shifting legal regimes.
- Important nuance:
  - Both sides (trap owners and pirates) claimed legitimacy: traps under law and “efficiency,” pirates under common-property and anti-waste arguments.
