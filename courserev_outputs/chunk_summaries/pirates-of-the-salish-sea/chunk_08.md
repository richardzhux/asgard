# Chunk 08 (units 5741-6640)

- **Key Concepts / Sections**

  - **Corporate trap owners breaking conservation laws**
    - Trap owners secretly fished during the weekly closed time, often paying watchmen extra to do so.
    - Fish pirates argued this was hypocritical: large traps could legally take 60,000 fish in one tide, but an individual taking 2,000 was labeled a “pirate.”
    - Many pirates justified robbing traps on the grounds that corporate owners were already stealing fish out of season.

  - **Ineffective enforcement and low penalties**
    - 1905: Washington’s fish commissioner admitted he expected operators to ignore new “closed time” regulations.
    - Evidence from BC (J.H. Todd & Sons) showed both American and Canadian traps ignored close seasons.
    - Some American trap owners were fined, but penalties were low, so it was more profitable to break the law and pay the fine.
    - 1911 official report: laws looked strict on paper, but in practice were ineffective because traps could be opened/closed in minutes by one person.

  - **Evasive tactics used by watchmen and owners**
    - Example: Walter Scott propped the trap apron open with pins tied to strings leading to his bunkhouse. If inspectors approached, he tugged the strings, pins dropped, and the apron closed—appearing compliant.
    - Example: Beryl Troxell Mason’s father (trap owner, 1910s–20s) sometimes illegally opened traps during closed time when fish were running, to make marginal operations profitable, as long as no one saw.

  - **Community attitudes toward “fish pirates”**
    - Many Euro-American/Euro-Canadian residents believed all citizens should have access to fish and did not see trap robbing as criminal.
    - Fish pirates like William Propst felt no shame about their activities and claimed they were well liked.
    - 1902 Anacortes American: reported that trap robbers did not see themselves as pirates or criminals at all.
    - Fish pirates were socially integrated: locals interacted with them, sometimes sought their advice (e.g., Red Custer warning Lee Bauter about a crooked operator), and even went on boat trips with them.

- **Definitions / Terms**

  - **Fish pirates / fish rustlers**: Independent fishers who illegally took fish from corporate fish traps (“company fish”), often justifying it as retaliation against corporate lawbreaking and monopolization.
  - **Closed time / close season**: Legally mandated weekly period when traps were supposed to be closed (not fishing) to protect salmon runs.
  - **Trap watchman**: Worker stationed at the trap to monitor it, often the one who secretly opened or closed the trap outside legal hours.

- **Examples**

  - Walter Scott’s string-and-pin system to instantly close traps if inspectors appeared.
  - Beryl Troxell Mason’s father secretly opening traps during closed time to “tip the scales to profitability.”
  - Red Custer (well-known fish pirate) giving honest advice to young fisherman Lee Bauter, helping him avoid a crooked operator.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

  - **Mistaking only pirates as lawbreakers**: The text emphasizes that corporate trap owners were equally or more involved in illegal fishing than the so‑called pirates.
  - **Assuming community condemnation**: Contrary to a standard “criminal vs. society” narrative, local white communities often sympathized with or even admired fish pirates; trap robbing did not always carry a strong social stigma.
  - **Overestimating legal effectiveness**: Laws appeared strict but were easy to evade; enforcement capacity and penalty size mattered more than written rules.
