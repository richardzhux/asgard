# Chunk 15 (units 11481-12380)

Key concepts / sections
- Legal conflicts over fish traps
- “Fish pirates” and anti-trap activity
- State, provincial, and federal regulation/enforcement
- Workers’ and fishermen’s attitudes toward traps and “piracy”
- Cross-border (U.S.–Canada) fishery issues

Definitions / ideas
- Fish traps: Large fixed gear used by canning companies/independents to catch salmon in bulk; legally contentious because of property, access, and conservation issues.
- Fish pirates: People who stole fish from traps or illegally fished in restricted areas; sometimes seen as criminals, sometimes as folk heroes by net fishermen opposed to traps.
- Trap litigation: A dense web of civil suits and court cases over:
  - Trespass onto trap sites
  - Ownership and location of trap sites
  - Conflicts between independent fishermen and corporate packers/canners

Key examples
- Numerous lawsuits:
  - J. A. Gould v. Matison Fredenburg et al. (1897)
  - William Legoe v. Chicago Fishing Company (1901)
  - A. Demers v. Sandy Spit Fish Company et al. (1901)
  - Fall and Sockeye Fish Company v. Point Roberts Fishing and Canning Company (1901)
- Press coverage:
  - “Fish Trap Litigation,” “More Trap Litigation,” “Sue for Trespass” – showing traps as a constant source of legal dispute.
  - “Pirates Infest Victoria Waters”; “Pirates vs. Fish Traps” – framing trap robbing as “piracy.”
  - “To Guard Fish Traps,” “Warrants for Trap Owners” – state response: patrols, guards, warrants, fines.
- Enforcement:
  - Fines against trap owners in 1905 ($50 or $500—source unclear).
  - Guarding traps with patrol boats and private guards.
- Labor/attitudes:
  - Oral histories (Propst, Vogt, Jones, Ginnett, Robinson, etc.) show:
    - Some fishermen quietly bought from or cooperated with fish pirates.
    - Many gillnetters/independent fishermen resented traps and sometimes sympathized with or aided pirates.
  - Fishermen’s unions occasionally mobilized around anti-trap issues.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Pirates” vs. company thieves:
  - Not all illegal fish removals were the same: some were opportunistic theft; others were part of a broader anti-trap, pro-net-fisher culture.
- Legality vs. legitimacy:
  - Traps were often legal but widely seen by working fishermen as unfair and monopolistic.
  - “Piracy” could be condemned in law but celebrated in oral traditions.
- National vs. local control:
  - Both U.S. and Canadian authorities (state/provincial and federal) were involved; regulations and enforcement did not always align across the border, creating confusion and opportunity for “piracy.”
- Overfishing vs. property conflict:
  - Many of these conflicts were about access/property and labor relations, not just conservation, even though conservation language appears in official reports.
