Key concepts / sections
- Escalating anti-piracy measures around fish traps  
- Cross-border coordination and pricing strategies  
- Theft at canneries and worker relations  
- Legal ambiguity over “fish piracy” and property rights in trapped fish  

Definitions / core ideas
- Fish piracy: Stealing salmon from commercial fishing gear (especially traps), or from canneries, for resale (often across the US–Canada border).  
- Trap salmon as property: Debate over whether salmon in traps counted as private property (owned by the trap owner) or were still “common property” until physically removed from the water.

Key points & examples

1. Anti-piracy measures by canners (especially in Puget Sound)
- DMF and local police used in B.C.; more aggressive private measures in northern Puget Sound (where piracy was worse).  
- PAF tactics:
  - Two watchmen per trap; pairing older + younger watchmen.  
  - Rotating crews between traps every 10 days to keep pirates guessing.  
  - 1902: patrol boats with searchlights, heavily armed watchmen ordered to “capture or kill” anyone caught robbing traps.  
- 1911 “big campaign” against fish pirates (Anacortes, Bellingham, Blaine):  
  - PAF built a special anti-piracy vessel.  
  - Other companies contributed fastest boats for a pirate patrol fleet.  
  - Despite this, piracy “for years” remained only “partially checked.”

2. Coordination with government / Coast Guard
- Late 1910s: American canners negotiated joint policing between cannery tenders and the newly established Coast Guard.  
- According to participant Walter Scott, some of the anti-piracy schemes were ineffective (“pitiful”).

3. Pricing strategies to reduce piracy
- 1903: Attempt at coordinated cross-border price-setting for fresh salmon (Washington State and B.C. canners).  
  - US canners wanted lower prices to reduce incentives for trap piracy and cross-border sale.  
  - B.C. canners insisted on higher piece rates.  
  - Result: Washington canners raised prices too, inadvertently maintaining or increasing incentives for rustling from traps.

4. Theft inside canneries and on docks
- Theft not only from traps, but also from canneries and wharves:  
  - Fraser River, 1900: 4 Japanese men stole cannery fish worth $118.80 and quickly resold them.  
  - Victoria, 1908: R. Roberts and Albert Mather arrested for stealing from a warehouse; 40–50 fish a day had been disappearing from wharves.  
    - Authorities suspected cannery workers (including fishermen) selling fish to local Chinese fish peddlers.  
- PAF’s internal security in Bellingham (1905):  
  - High fence around the plant.  
  - Watchmen at gates, restricted visitor passes.  
  - Daily searches of employee lunch pails and baskets.  
- These measures likely increased worker resentment and sympathy for pirates/rogue workers.

5. Legal battles and ambiguity around fish piracy
- Washington canners’ legal strategy mostly failed due to vague state laws:
  - 1902: Wright Brothers and PAF charged five men for trap theft.  
    - Prosecuted as grand larceny; jury reduced to “attempt to commit petit larceny”; unclear if any jail time.  
- Crucial early-1900s case involving Carlisle Packing Co.:  
  - Defense argued fish are “of a roving nature”; being in traps does not equal possession.  
  - Walter Scott: case effectively established that fish remain common property until removed from water.  
- Another court case: defense lawyer put three salmon on the table and asked the trap owner to identify which were his; he couldn’t, case dismissed.  
- Despite precedents elsewhere (e.g., 1902 Ohio ruling that fish in traps constituted private property and could be the subject of larceny),  
  - Washington lacked a specific anti–fish piracy statute for years.  
  - Trap owners argued trapped fish were private property and removal was theft, but had little legal support until a much later anti-piracy law.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming “piracy” only meant at-sea violence: here it primarily refers to systematic theft of fish from traps and canneries, often by other fish workers.  
- Confusing general property law with specific fishery law:  
  - Other states (like Ohio) treated trapped fish as property, but Washington’s lack of explicit statute made prosecution difficult.  
- Overestimating effectiveness of private policing: heavy armament, patrol boats, and Coast Guard cooperation did not eliminate piracy due to strong economic incentives and legal loopholes.  
- Ignoring labor context: strict surveillance and searches at canneries may have fostered worker sympathy for pirates rather than deterring theft.
