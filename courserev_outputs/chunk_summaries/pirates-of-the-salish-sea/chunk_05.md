# Chunk 05 (units 3281-4180)

Key concepts / sections
- **Who were the fish pirates?**
  - Often moved between **wage work in the fisheries** and more lucrative **pirating**.
  - Mostly of **European / Euro-American / Euro-Canadian** descent.
  - Some **Native** pirates; possibly some **Japanese** fishermen (esp. active in B.C. with access to boats).
  - Social background varied: could include men from **“highly respected” families**.

- **Scale and organization of piracy**
  - Estimates range widely: **a few** to **several hundred** pirates active at any given time.
  - Local recollections:
    - W. J. Beale: at least **4 boats** with **8–16 men each** operating from Anacortes, with many more pirates in area.
    - PAF report (early 1900s): **3 boats**, **4–6 men each** (12–18 men total) robbing Boundary Bay traps in one evening.
    - 1909 trap attack: up to **40 men** working together near the 49th parallel.
    - 1902 Whatcom County sheriff: claimed **500 men** engaged in fish pirating in northern Puget Sound (likely exaggerated or self-justifying).
  - Identity management: some pirates **masked**, others **openly boasted** about pirating.

- **Theft beyond fish: “harbor pirates” and gear theft**
  - Pirates also stole **boats, nets, sails, gear**—not just fish.
  - “Harbor pirates” hit **Port Townsend (1898)** and escaped despite pursuit.
  - **Fraser River Canners’ Association** particularly targeted.
    - Secretary **W. D. Burdis** repeatedly complained to B.C. Provincial Police about:
      - American gear thieves
      - Illegal fish smuggling
      - Requested more protection between **Bowen Island and Point Roberts**.
  - By 1909–1910s:
    - Multiple thefts per day during season were **common**.
    - Gear and boats became **more expensive**, ownership harder for individuals.
    - Thieves sometimes went as far as **Rivers Inlet** and the **Skeena River** to steal.

- **Border use and legal jurisdictions**
  - Pirates and gear thieves exploited the **Anglo-American border**:
    - Used cross-border movement to **avoid detection** and **jurisdiction**.
    - Stolen gear often recovered on the **American side**.
  - They maximized profits by using different **markets** and **legal regimes** on each side.

- **Motivations / justifications for piracy**
  - Seen as a response to **injustices in the salmon fishery**:
    - Large canners’ **monopoly** via fish traps.
    - **Unequal access** to a resource **theoretically held in common**.
    - Displacement of small operators; inability to afford **seining technology**.
  - The West’s ideological context:
    - Supposed to be a region of **opportunity and free labor for white men**, not corporate monopolies and exploitative wage work.
  - Many white men framed piracy as **“evening the odds”** against big corporations.
  - Oral histories suggest pirates **targeted traps owned by large corporations**, not small operators.

Definitions / key terms
- **Fish pirates**: Individuals who illegally harvested salmon from fish traps, often at night and often crossing jurisdictional lines.
- **Harbor pirates**: Thieves focusing on **boats and gear** in harbors rather than just stealing fish from traps.
- **Fish traps**: Fixed gear installations that captured salmon; capital-intensive and typically owned by **large canning companies**, critical to their near-monopoly.

Examples
- **Anacortes operations**: At least four pirate boats with 8–16 crew each, implying a substantial local pirating community.
- **Boundary Bay robbery**: 3 boats, 12–18 men, robbing company traps in one evening.
- **1909 mass attack**: Up to 40 men attacking traps near the 49th parallel.
- **Burdis’s “laundry list”**: Documented repeated thefts from specific B.C. canneries (Brunswick, Terra Nova, British America Cannery).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- **Numbers and exaggeration**:
  - Official claims (e.g., 500 pirates) may be **inflated**—sometimes to justify poor enforcement records.
  - Exact counts of pirates are **impossible to determine** from the historical record.
- **Over-romanticizing pirates**:
  - Pirates had **economic and ideological grievances**, but also:
    - Stole from smaller canneries
    - Engaged in violent or high-risk acts.
- **Homogenous image of pirates**:
  - While often described as white wage workers resisting monopoly, the group was **ethnically mixed** to some degree and included Native and possibly Japanese participants.
- **Target selection**:
  - Oral histories say they mainly targeted **big corporate traps**, but this may partly reflect **memory and narrative framing** rather than consistent practice.
