# Chunk 12 (units 9021-9920)

Key concepts / sections
- Legal status of fish piracy in Washington
- Canners’ and trap owners’ complicity in piracy
- Inter-company piracy (stealing from competitors’ traps)
- Fish piracy as labor strategy vs. conservation
- Contextual references to labor and “piracy” in other resource industries (from notes)

Definitions / core ideas
- Fish piracy:  
  Unauthorized taking of fish from traps, wheels, seines, or nets owned/operated by others.
- Private property argument for trapped fish:  
  Trap owners claimed fish already confined in their gear were their private property, so taking them was theft/larceny.
- Gross misdemeanor (1915 WA law):  
  In Washington, as of 1915, stealing from traps/wheels/seines/nets became a gross misdemeanor; watchmen could also be fined for not closing traps during closed seasons.

Key points & examples
- Legal evolution:
  - Before 1915, Washington had no specific anti–fish piracy law, despite precedents in other states.
  - A 1902 Ohio ruling on fish larceny supported trap owners’ view that trapped fish were legally private property.
  - Washington only passed explicit anti–fish piracy legislation in 1915.
  - The law:
    - Made stealing from traps/wheels/seines/nets a gross misdemeanor.
    - Fined watchmen $250–$2,000 for failing to close traps during closed periods.

- Canners’ mixed role:
  - Trap owners and canners publicly condemned piracy but:
    - Sometimes bought fish from pirates, giving them a market and keeping them in business.
    - Former fisher Bill Bessner: canneries were “always glad to buy fish” and “didn’t care where they got them and didn’t ask questions.”
    - Canners may have:
      - Encouraged watchmen to fish illegally.
      - Let watchmen take legal blame, or paid fines on their behalf (shifting risk down the chain).

- Piracy between companies:
  - Some trap owners/canners hired pirates to steal from competitors’ traps to:
    - Make up for poor catches.
    - Undercut rivals’ fish supply.
  - Example:  
    - Canner Bill Lowman asked William Propst to steal from a rival trap; Propst angrily refused, nearly leading to a fight.
  - Fisherman Albert Ginnett: claimed companies pirated “between themselves … a whole lot,” more than people realized.

- Labor control, not conservation:
  - Fish piracy served as:
    - A tactic for local fishermen to retain some control over their working conditions.
    - A way to profit from their skills in an increasingly capital-intensive, monopolistic fishery (dominated by traps and big companies).
  - Despite their criticisms of trap “wastefulness,” pirates were not conservationists:
    - No evidence they supported stricter conservation measures.
    - Their actions worsened regulatory chaos for state officials.

Contextual references (from notes)
- Broader “piracy” in resource contexts:
  - Historians have studied similar conflicts (e.g., oyster pirates vs. oyster growers, poaching vs. property rights).
  - Links to ideas of “social bandits” and rural resistance (Hobsbawm, Thompson, Sahlins, etc.).
- Labor history side-note:
  - Chinese and Japanese labor contractors, cannery work scarcity, and disputes over wages/technology are part of the broader setting of industrial fisheries and labor struggles (though not central to this specific piracy section).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing rhetoric with motive:
  - Fishermen’s anti-trap rhetoric was not primarily about conservation; it was more about access, control, and economic survival.
- Overestimating legal clarity:
  - Before 1915, enforcement against fish pirates in Washington was weak and ambiguous, even though some other states already treated trapped fish as private property.
- Viewing canners as purely victims:
  - In practice, canners both suffered from and benefited from piracy (by buying pirated fish or hiring pirates against competitors).
