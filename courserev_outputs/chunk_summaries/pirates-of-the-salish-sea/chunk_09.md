# Chunk 09 (units 6561-7460)

Key concepts / sections
- Community relations with fish pirates
- Local justice and enforcement failures
- Perceived injustice of corporate canneries and traps
- Fish pirates’ use of conservation rhetoric
- Debate over trap wastefulness vs other gear
- Broader problem of wastefulness in the salmon industry

Definitions / core ideas
- Fish pirate: An illegal fisher who stole fish from traps or violated regulations (e.g., closed times) but was often socially integrated into local communities.
- Fish trap: Fixed gear used by canneries to intercept salmon; operated continuously except during weekly closed times.
- Bycatch: Non-target fish (or undersized fish) caught in traps; often discarded to save time/money.
- Weekly closed time: Period when fishing was supposed to stop; traps were often secretly fished through this closure.
- Progressive Era conservation concerns: Ideas about scientific management, efficient use of resources, and opposition to waste, which pirates co‑opted to justify poaching.

Examples from text
- Red Custer:
  - A “well‑known fish pirate” who gave fatherly advice to Bauter, warning him away from a “crooked and vengeful” operator at Cherry Point.
  - Shows pirates as moral actors within local social networks.
- Pirate Bert Jones:
  - Took local young women out to demonstrate poaching methods.
  - Stole fish from Edith and Ray Robinson’s traps, then sold the stolen fish back to them; they remembered him fondly.
- Troxell family story:
  - Family suspected a friend was a fish pirate; he joked about leaving a fish on their gate.
  - Next morning a dressed sockeye was hanging on the gate—illustrates normalized, even humorous, view of poaching.
- Jury nullification:
  - 1890s Fraser River case: three men caught stealing gear; trial moved due to “public feeling,” but jury still refused to convict.
  - Shows community unwillingness to punish pirates.
- Unequal enforcement:
  - Complaints (1895) that “poor fishermen are fined” while large canners ignore laws “with impunity,” especially regarding trap fishing in closed time.

Arguments about traps and wastefulness
- Trap supporters’ claims:
  - Traps are fixed; unlike mobile fishers (purse seiners), they cannot “chase” fish, so they are inherently limited.
  - Fish are taken only when canneries need them, preventing gluts and spoilage in processing plants.
  - Implied: traps = efficient, less wasteful.
- Anti-trap / pirate & movable gear fishers’ claims:
  - “Traps never sleep”: they catch continuously except weekly closed time, which is weakly enforced.
  - Overcrowded traps can cause salmon to suffocate (evidence hinted, but underreported).
  - Trap structures plus inadequate mesh regulations cause substantial bycatch, which is discarded.
- Larger waste problem (beyond traps vs other gears):
  - Canners often used only “prime bellies” and discarded the rest of the fish.
  - Massive catches (10,000–20,000 fish per trap haul) plus rising purse seine and gillnet effort led to more fish than canneries could process.
  - Reports of rivers “alive with dead fish” highlight systemic overharvest and spoilage, not just one gear type’s waste.

Pirates and conservation rhetoric
- Pirates portrayed themselves as:
  - Victims of wrongful exclusion from “fishing commons” by outside corporate canners and trap owners.
  - Allies of conservation against “wasteful villains” (big traps/canneries).
- They leveraged:
  - Progressive Era discourse on scientific management, conservation, and anti‑waste to justify illegal fishing.
- Their arguments raised:
  - Which gear/user is truly most wasteful?
  - Which actors should be more tightly regulated? This became central in US‑Canada salmon conservation negotiations.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Seeing pirates as purely criminal:
  - In the local context they could be trusted neighbors, jokey companions, sometimes even viewed as more just than corporate operators.
- Reducing conservation conflict to “legal vs illegal”:
  - The text shows overlapping moral economies: locals viewed monopolistic traps and uneven enforcement as unjust, making pirates more sympathetic.
- Over-focusing on trap waste alone:
  - The text stresses that overall industry practices (overcapacity, selective canning of only the best parts) were major sources of waste, not just the existence of traps.
- Assuming strict law enforcement:
  - Community solidarity, jury resistance, and bias favoring large canners meant laws were unevenly and sometimes ineffectively applied.
