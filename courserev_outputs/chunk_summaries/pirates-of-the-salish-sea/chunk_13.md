Key concepts / sections
- Corporate control of fish traps
- Fish piracy (salmon poaching from traps)
- Enforcement and anti‑poaching efforts
- Technology changes in fishing (gas engines)
- Labor/management practices around trap watchmen

Definitions / main ideas
- Fish traps: Fixed gear installations used by canneries to intercept salmon; by 1905, large canning companies owned most of the 213 listed traps in Puget Sound (159 clearly in corporate hands).
- Fish pirates / salmon poachers: People stealing salmon from corporate traps or otherwise illegally taking fish; often used boats to raid traps at night.
- Watchmen: Employees hired to guard traps and scows from pirates; some sources note watchmen were not always paid reliably, which could weaken enforcement.
- Enforcement vessels: Government or company boats used to pursue poachers; effectiveness varied depending on boat power and operator skill.

Examples / evidence
- Late 19th–early 20th c.:
  - 1898: Local paper reports “trouble with thieves” for cannerymen and trapmen near Anacortes.
  - 1903: Company correspondence complaining about fish piracy and problems with protection.
  - 1905: Pacific Fisherman article on “malicious injury to traps.”
  - 1908: Several Vancouver papers report “Salmon Pirates” near Bellingham taking “scowloads of salmon.”
  - 1909: Fraser River canners’ association and police correspondence document cross‑border poaching and concerns about pirates “from Fraser.”
  - 1911–1912: Multiple newspaper reports of pirates firing on watchmen, dramatic chases, and raids on specific corporate traps (e.g., Todd traps).
- Oral histories:
  - Bert Jones and others describe active fish piracy from roughly the 1910s until Washington abolished traps in 1934.
  - Watchmen sometimes were not paid; oral histories give first‑hand accounts of piracy techniques and responses.

Technological / structural points
- Gasoline engines:
  - Increasing use in the fishing industry by the early 1900s made small boats faster and more mobile.
  - This enhanced pirates’ ability to conduct quick raids and escape from slower enforcement craft.
- Corporate concentration:
  - Large canning firms dominated trap ownership, making piracy both an economic challenge to big companies and a focal point of class and resource conflict.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Fish pirates” vs. ordinary poachers:
  - In this context, “pirates” often specifically refers to organized theft from corporate traps (sometimes at scale—scowloads), not just casual illegal fishing.
- Effectiveness of enforcement:
  - Some dramatic arrests or chases get highlighted in newspapers, but archival and oral sources suggest enforcement was often spotty and under‑resourced.
- Motives and perspectives:
  - Corporate and government records frame piracy as purely criminal.
  - Oral histories and some secondary sources hint at broader tensions over access to salmon and resentment of corporate trap monopolies, but this nuance can be lost if you rely only on official reports.
