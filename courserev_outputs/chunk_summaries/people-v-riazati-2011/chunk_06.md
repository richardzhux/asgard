# Chunk 06 (units 4101-5000)

Key concepts / sections
- Defense expert testimony on animal care
- Cross-examination limitations of expert
- Beginning of “Discussion” section: alleged instructional error
- Elements and mens rea for animal neglect under Cal. Penal Code § 597(b)
- Role of invited error doctrine
- Use of prior cases (Speegle, Brian) for jury instructions
  

Definitions / rules

1. Animal neglect under § 597(b) (as framed by prior case law)
   - From People v. Speegle:
     - Prosecution must prove a:
       - “Grossly negligent act or omission”
       - That “caused danger to an animal’s life.”
   - There is no standard CALCRIM instruction for § 597(b); courts borrow from case law.

2. Gross negligence for § 597(b)
   - From People v. Brian:
     - Requires **criminal negligence**, not ordinary negligence.
     - Defined as:
       - A reckless, gross, or culpable departure from the ordinary standard of due care.
       - So extreme a departure from what an ordinarily prudent person would do under similar circumstances
       - As to be **incompatible with a proper regard for animal life**.

3. Invited error doctrine
   - A party who requests a particular jury instruction generally cannot later challenge that instruction on appeal.
   - Here, Riazati requested the challenged “great bodily injury / high risk” language, so the court views him as barred by invited error from complaining about it.

4. Appellate court’s stance (overview from this chunk)
   - Court signals two conclusions:
     1. Invited error bars Riazati’s challenge.
     2. The challenged instructions are, in any event, correct statements of law.

  

Examples / evidence from this chunk

- Defense vet (Gayle Roberts) testimony:
  - Did not:
    - Personally examine the animals.
    - See living conditions before April 16 video.
    - Have formal training in animal neglect cases.
  - Opinions:
    - Rabbit injury:
      - Skin condition could result from bite.
      - Home treatment with hydrogen peroxide and Neosporin is appropriate.
      - In April 16 video, rabbits looked playful, bright, alert.
      - One bowl of water looked contaminated with feces, but still drinkable.
      - Injured rabbit in its own cage = appropriate to prevent further harm.
    - Dogs:
      - German Shepherd’s fly strike scars: fly strikes common in outside dogs, usually not fatal.
      - No dogs showed distemper, diarrhea, kennel cough, heatstroke, hookworm, roundworm, or coccidiosis.
      - Dogs in video appeared friendly, greeting officers and jumping on them.
      - Would expect vomiting/diarrhea if dogs had been eating rotten food; did not see this.
      - Chow with pneumonia: not coughing at intake; nasal discharge not visible in video.
      - No evidence the German Shepherd and two mixes were improperly fed or watered.
      - Housing sick Chow separately was appropriate.
      - Tapeworms not a major life risk.
    - Birds:
      - Birds may defecate in food/water or put food in water, which discolors water.
      - Birds will eat around feces in food.
      - Bird with feather loss was overplucking itself (self-inflicted).

- Cross-examination concessions:
  - Roberts had never had a client with so many animals.
  - She would not give her own dog the food and water shown in some yard photographs.
  - Acknowledged:
    - The depicted food could cause disease if eaten.
    - The depicted water could cause disease if drunk.

  

Pitfalls / common confusions

- Confusing **ordinary negligence** with **criminal (gross) negligence**:
  - Ordinary negligence (simple carelessness) is not enough for § 597(b); there must be conduct that shows a reckless disregard for animal life.
  
- Misreading the statute to require actual injury or death:
  - Under the Speegle formulation, liability can arise where a grossly negligent act/omission **creates danger to an animal’s life**; actual death or serious injury is not required.

- Challenging one’s own requested instructions:
  - On appeal, a defendant normally cannot attack an instruction that defense counsel requested (invited error), even if later argued to reduce the prosecution’s burden.

- Over-relying on defense expert:
  - Roberts’ opinions were limited by:
    - No pre-seizure exam.
    - No site visit before the key video.
    - No specialized training in neglect.
  - On cross, she conceded she personally found the food and water conditions unacceptable and potentially disease-causing.
