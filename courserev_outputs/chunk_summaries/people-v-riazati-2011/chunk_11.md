# Chunk 11 (units 8201-8608)

Key concepts / sections
- Sufficiency of the evidence (criminal appeals)
- Penal Code § 597(b): animal neglect / cruelty (failure to provide proper care)
- Standard of review: “substantial evidence” and “reasonable trier of fact”
- Multiple counts: one count per species in defendant’s possession and care
- Mental state: reckless creation of a high risk of great bodily injury

Definitions / rules
- Substantial evidence: Evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
- § 597(b) animal neglect (as applied): Liability where acts or omissions in caring for animals recklessly create a high risk of serious harm, including through inadequate food, water, shelter, or protection from unsanitary conditions.

Examples from the case
- German Shepherd: thin, hair loss around tail → indicated malnutrition and dirty conditions.
- Chow puppy: pneumonia, very thin/underweight, loss of spinal muscle mass, no palpable fat.
- Rabbits and guinea pigs: underweight, dehydrated.
- Birds: inadequate food covered in droppings; water contaminated with feces (disease risk).
- Duck: emaciated, covered with feces, lacked shelter and bathing water.
- Chicken: emaciated and starving.
- Procedural context: Department officers had previously tried (from Feb. 28 to Apr. 16) to get Riazati to correct the “deplorable” conditions before seizing animals.

Court’s holding / outcome
- Evidence was sufficient to support all six § 597(b) convictions:
  - One count for each species under his possession and care.
  - Expert veterinary testimony plus observed conditions met the substantial evidence standard.
- Judgment affirmed; petition for review denied by the California Supreme Court.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Not required that animals actually die or suffer catastrophic injury; risk of great bodily injury from serious neglect is enough.
- Defendant’s mere disagreement with the evidence is not enough on appeal; appellant must show the record lacks substantial evidence.
- Multiple animals can support multiple counts, potentially grouped by species (as in this case).
