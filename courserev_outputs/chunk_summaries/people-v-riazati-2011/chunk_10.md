# Chunk 10 (units 7381-8280)

- **Key Concepts / Sections**
  - **Penal Code § 597(b)** (animal cruelty/neglect):
    - Covers grossly negligent conduct that:
      - Deprives an animal under one’s care of **necessary sustenance, drink, or shelter**, or  
      - Causes an animal to be so deprived, or  
      - **Subjects any animal to needless suffering.**
    - Not limited to risk of death; includes conduct that **recklessly exposes the animal to a high risk of great bodily injury (GBI).**

  - **Standard of Review – Sufficiency of the Evidence**
    - **Substantial evidence test**:
      - Evidence viewed **in the light most favorable to the judgment**.
      - Must be **reasonable, credible, and of solid value**.
      - Any reasonable trier of fact could find elements proven **beyond a reasonable doubt**.
    - **Single witness rule**:
      - Uncorroborated testimony of a single witness can be enough, **unless** physically impossible or inherently improbable.
    - Appellate courts:
      - Do **not** reweigh evidence.
      - Do **not** resolve conflicts or reassess credibility.

- **Definitions / Formulations**
  - **Gross negligence (in this context)**:
    - Reckless conduct that creates a **high risk of great bodily injury** or death to an animal under one’s care.
    - Not mere carelessness; it must rise to a level where the risk is **“high”**, not just possible or speculative.

  - **Great bodily injury (GBI) to animals**
    - Significant or substantial injury; more serious than minor or moderate harm.
    - Court notes as a matter of **common sense** that GBI often precedes death, supporting inclusion of high risk of GBI within § 597(b).

  - **Appellant’s burden**
    - On appeal, defendant must **affirmatively show** the evidence is insufficient.
    - If the defendant only argues an incorrect legal standard (e.g., “must involve high risk of death”) and does not challenge under the **correct** standard (high risk of GBI), he fails his burden.

- **Examples (from reasoning, not factual specifics)**
  - Statute applies where a caretaker:
    - Grossly fails to provide food, water, or shelter in a way that:
      - Creates a **high risk that the animal will suffer serious physical harm** (e.g., starvation to serious debilitation, severe dehydration, exposure leading to serious injury), **even if not necessarily death**.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**
  - **Misstating the required risk**:
    - Error: Believing § 597(b) requires conduct that creates a **high risk of death** only.
    - Correct: Liability attaches when conduct creates a **high risk of great bodily injury** or death.
  
  - **Overlooking breadth of “needless suffering”**:
    - The statute is not confined to death or GBI wording; it also punishes causing **needless suffering**, which supports a broader protective purpose.

  - **Appeal strategy error**:
    - Defendant in Riazati argued no high risk of death, but **did not argue** lack of evidence of high risk of GBI.
    - Court rejects the claim because it rests on a **false premise** about the required risk and fails to attack the evidence under the proper standard.

  - **Role of appellate courts**:
    - Common mistake is to treat appeal as a retrial on facts.
    - In reality, appellate courts accept the jury’s credibility determinations and factual resolution if supported by **substantial evidence**.
