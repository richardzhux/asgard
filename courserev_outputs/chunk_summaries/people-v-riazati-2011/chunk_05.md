# Chunk 05 (units 3281-4180)

Key concepts / sections

1. **Conditions observed on April 16 search**
   - Backyard:
     - Stagnant, green water with bacteria growth.
     - Larvae in a water bowl.
     - Dog food bowl with old food; another bowl with rotten‑smelling food.
     - Free‑roaming duck, later caged by officers.
     - Chicken in wire cage with only a piece of plastic as “shelter,” feces all over cage; shelter deemed insufficient.
   - Inside house:
     - Three dogs; one crated dog with dirty and insufficient water.
     - Birds again found inside; only change from prior visit was location.
     - Bird food bowls heavily contaminated with feces.
     - Bird water bowls discolored and contaminated with feces.
   - Total seizure: **90 animals** removed and inventoried.

2. **Veterinarian Dr. Julie Maher’s findings (prosecution expert)**
   - **Dogs**
     - German Shepherd:
       - Hair loss around tail → indicates malnutrition + dirty conditions.
       - Ear scars → consistent with fly bites due to poor sanitation.
     - Chow Chow puppy:
       - Green nasal discharge and abnormally quiet lungs → pneumonia (bacteria, fluid, pus in lungs); required antibiotics.
       - Very underweight, loss of spinal muscle mass, no palpable fat.
       - Tapeworms in stool (also found in another German Shepherd and some other dogs).
   - **Rabbits and guinea pigs**
     - Too many rabbits; insufficient uncluttered and safe living space.
     - Inadequate food and water overall.
     - Guinea pig housing:
       - Should have solid floors (wire floors predispose to foot sores).
       - Should have sipper bottles and hiding places (nervous prey species).
     - Main medical issues: **dehydration + low body weight**, attributed to underfeeding.
     - Brownish‑red rabbit:
       - Dehydrated, dirty with feces.
       - Abscesses over pelvis and back, tattered ears → likely caused by bites from other rabbits, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and/or lack of food.
   - **Duck & chicken**
     - Duck:
       - Emaciated, covered in feces.
       - No proper shelter or bathing water provided.
     - Chicken:
       - Emaciated; Maher opined starvation due to inappropriate or insufficient food.
   - **Birds (general)**
     - Inadequate shelter; cages overcrowded and full of feces.
     - Food contaminated with droppings; water contaminated with droppings, algae, or bacteria.
     - Medical implications:
       - Birds should not eat feces; risk of **bacterial and parasitic disease**.
       - Contaminated water → **parasitic, bacterial, and fungal diseases**.

3. **Defense case evidence**
   - **Mother (Moghadase Tavakoli)**
     - Her brown rabbit injured its back at her home.
     - She called Riazati; he applied medication and took the rabbit.
     - Purpose: suggest the rabbit’s injury did not originate in defendant’s care.
   - **Neighbor (David Adam Baruch)**
     - Visited twice (between Feb 28 and Apr 16).
     - First visit:
       - Saw food and water in bird cages; no feces smell in house.
       - Did not recall seeing a brown rabbit.
     - April 14 visit:
       - Birds in indoor cages; rabbits and guinea pigs in outdoor pen.
       - Did not see dogs; did not see any dead rabbits.
       - Rabbits appeared normal, hydrated, proper weight; food and water appeared adequate.
   - **Nephew (Ehsan Bagheri‑Anderson)**
     - Early March visit (post‑Feb 28 officer visit):
       - Bird cages looked clean; saw clean water and food.
     - Early April:
       - Observed Riazati cleaning the brown rabbit’s injury with hydrogen peroxide and ointment; rabbit’s water appeared clear.
     - April 13:
       - Took video footage inside house (bird cages, water, food; rabbits).
       - Opinion: animals had clear water, appropriate food, and shelter.

Definitions / legal relevance (implicit)

- **Neglect / failure to provide proper care** (context for animal cruelty charges):
  - Evidence: contaminated water, feces‑filled cages, emaciation, dehydration, overcrowding, lack of shelter or appropriate housing, untreated or poorly treated medical conditions.
  - Expert testimony connects conditions → **malnutrition, disease risk, and suffering.**

Examples from text

- Example of inadequate sanitation: bird cages with food and water contaminated by feces and algae.
- Example of underfeeding: emaciated duck and chicken; dehydrated, underweight rabbits and guinea pigs.
- Example of improper housing: guinea pigs on wire floors; rabbit overcrowding; minimal plastic “shelter” for chicken.

Pitfalls / common confusions

- **Source of injuries vs. responsibility**:
  - Defense: brown rabbit injured at mother’s home, with defendant providing treatment.
  - Prosecution: rabbit’s abscesses and tattered ears consistent with ongoing overcrowding and fights at defendant’s home.
- **Snapshot vs. ongoing conditions**:
  - Defense witnesses saw acceptable conditions on specific dates.
  - Prosecution emphasizes vet exam findings and conditions on search day plus cumulative health issues suggesting long‑term neglect.
- **Lay observations vs. expert medical opinion**:
  - Neighbors/family perceive animals as “normal” or “adequately fed.”
  - Vet interprets clinical signs (emaciation, dehydration, hair loss, parasites) as evidence of neglect.
