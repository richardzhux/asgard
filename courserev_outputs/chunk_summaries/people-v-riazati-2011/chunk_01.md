# Chunk 01 (units 1-900)

Key Concepts / Sections
- Case: People v. Riazati (2011), 195 Cal.App.4th 514
- Statute at issue: California Penal Code § 597(b) (animal cruelty/neglect)
- Issues on appeal:
  1. Whether jury instructions (requested by defendant) allowing conviction based on “high risk of great bodily injury” were erroneous.
  2. Whether evidence was sufficient for six animal neglect convictions.
- Holding:
  - Convictions affirmed.
  - Invited error doctrine barred challenge to jury instructions.
  - Instructions were legally correct in any event.
  - Evidence was sufficient for all six counts.

Definitions / Doctrines
- General duty to instruct:
  - Trial court must instruct jury on general principles of law relevant to issues raised by the evidence.

- Invited Error (re jury instructions):
  - A defendant cannot complain on appeal about an instruction that:
    - The defense requested, and
    - Was the product of a “conscious and deliberate tactical choice.”
  - Effect: bars appellate review of that claimed instructional error.

- Penal Code § 597(b) (as interpreted here):
  - Targets “grossly negligent conduct” toward animals.
  - Applies to a person who:
    - Has custody of, or is responsible for care of, an animal, and
    - Commits an act or omission that:
      - Deprives the animal of necessary sustenance, drink, or shelter, OR
      - Causes an animal to be so deprived, OR
      - Subjects an animal to needless suffering, AND
    - Does so with gross negligence.

- Gross negligence in this context:
  - Conduct that “recklessly exposes the animal to a high risk of great bodily injury.”
  - High risk requirement: risk must be “high,” not just minimal or speculative.

- “Great bodily injury” vs. death:
  - Court rejects the idea that § 597(b) requires a risk of death.
  - Liability can be based on high risk of great bodily injury:
    - Rationale: great bodily injury is often a precursor to death, so protecting against GBI is consistent with legislative intent to protect against risk of death.

Examples / Application from the Case
- Facts (as summarized):
  - Defendant had accumulated more than 90 animals.
  - Evidence showed animals under his care were:
    - Thin
    - Dehydrated
    - Lacked adequate food, water, and shelter.
- Charges:
  - 2 counts felony animal neglect.
  - 4 counts misdemeanor animal neglect.
  - One count per species of animal found in his possession and care.
- Evidence sufficiency:
  - Substantial evidence supported finding that:
    - His acts and omissions (shortage of food, water, shelter) recklessly created a high risk of great bodily injury to the animals.
  - Thus, all six convictions under § 597(b) were supported.

Pitfalls / Common Confusions
- Misreading § 597(b):
  - Confusion: thinking the statute requires a risk of death to the animal.
  - Clarification: high risk of “great bodily injury” is enough; statute is broad and covers serious neglect leading to GBI even short of death.

- Challenging your own requested instruction:
  - If defense tactically requests an instruction, they usually cannot later argue it was error (invited error).
  - Key exam point: distinguish between:
    - Simple failure to object (forfeiture), vs.
    - Tactical request (invited error, stronger bar to review).

- Level of risk:
  - Not any risk suffices; must be a “high” risk of great bodily injury due to gross negligence.
  - Look for evidence of systemic or serious neglect (e.g., many animals, obvious malnutrition/dehydration), not just minor or isolated mistakes.
