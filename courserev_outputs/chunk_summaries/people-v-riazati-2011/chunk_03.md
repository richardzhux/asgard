# Chunk 03 (units 1641-2540)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Initial inspection (Feb 28) – enclosed patio & interior**
    - Officer Oliver issues a *correctable citation* after traffic stop; sees animals through sliding glass door and enters patio to check welfare.
    - **Enclosed patio conditions**
      - Free‑roaming rabbits & guinea pigs at her feet; at least 20 rabbits.
      - ~30 birds, most caged; some flying through vertical blinds.
      - 9 chickens total; 8 tightly caged with insufficient room to move; 1 free‑roaming chicken leaning weakly against glass, unresponsive.
      - Floor: soiled hay and feces; strong odor of feces, urine, and ammonia; inadequate ventilation (windows barely open).
      - Feces on birdseed; brownish‑green water in cages, some with feces.
      - Some rabbits/guinea pigs had coats stained with feces.
    - **Inside the house (kitchen/living room)**
      - Large smeared feces stains on kitchen floor; same strong odor inside.
      - Glass aquarium full of finches; one bird missing many feathers → concern for aggression/pecking and poor sanitation.
      - Adult Boxer dog in covered crate: thin, no access to water; officer advises on proper feeding.
    - **Enforcement response**
      - Riazati refuses further inspection of house.
      - Violations noted: **inadequate food, water, ventilation, sanitation**.
      - Officer educates Riazati on correcting conditions; issues **notice of complaint**.
      - One rat relinquished; no other animals seized at this time (educational, corrective approach).

  - **Second inspection (Mar 8) – backyard reorganization**
    - Front yard unchanged; backyard junk rearranged but still cluttered.
    - Rabbits & guinea pigs moved to outdoor pen:
      - No visible rabbit pellets, leafy greens, or other food; officer cannot recall seeing water.
      - Insects buzzing; animals “living in their own filth” → poor sanitation.
    - Dogs: 4 of 5 seen; condition same as Feb 28:
      - Concerns remain about **shelter and sanitation**.
      - Dog pen has no roof; strong, foul odor.
    - Birds:
      - Many moved outdoors; cages stacked so upper birds defecate/urinate on lower birds.
      - Food still contaminated with feces/urine; water appears to contain feces.
      - No roof over most cages → inadequate shelter.
    - Finches in indoor aquarium: conditions unchanged; concern about feces/urine in food and water.
    - Patio: some soiled hay/feces removed, but significant amount remains.
    - Officer again orally advises specific corrective actions re: food, water, shelter for each animal type.

  - **Third inspection (Mar 15)**
    - Officer returns alone; Riazati absent.
    - Cannot access backyard or animals.
    - Front yard condition essentially unchanged.

  - **Fourth inspection (Mar 21) – start**
    - Officer returns with another officer; photographs front/back yards and most inside areas.
    - (Narrative continues beyond this chunk.)

- **Definitions / legal ideas (implicit)**

  - **Inadequate food/water/shelter/ventilation/sanitation**: core elements of animal neglect/cruelty statutes; here illustrated by:
    - Contaminated food/water, lack of any visible food/water, animals confined in filth.
    - Overcrowded cages, poor ventilation, lack of roof or protection from elements.

- **Examples from the facts**

  - Weak, unresponsive chicken leaning on glass.
  - Brownish‑green cage water with feces; feces in birdseed.
  - Dogs with no roofed shelter and strong ammonia/feces odor.
  - Finches in aquarium, one missing feathers likely due to pecking.
  - Rabbits/guinea pigs with feces‑stained coats in unsanitary pens.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **“Improvement” vs. legal compliance**: Moving animals (e.g., to outdoor pens) can look like progress but may still be neglect if food, water, shelter, and sanitation remain inadequate.
  - **Stacked cages**: Can appear space‑efficient but legally problematic because waste falls on animals below, worsening sanitation and health.
  - **Notice and education**: Issuance of a notice of complaint and advice does not mean no crime occurred; it reflects enforcement discretion and a chance to correct before further action.
