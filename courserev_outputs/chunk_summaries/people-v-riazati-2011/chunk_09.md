# Chunk 09 (units 6561-7460)

Key concepts / sections:
- **Invited Error Doctrine**
- **Penal Code § 597(b) – Animal Cruelty/Neglect**
- **Gross Negligence Standard in Animal Neglect**
- **Case comparison: People v. Speegle**

Definitions / rules:
- **Invited error doctrine**  
  - A defendant who **affirmatively requests** a jury instruction (or specific language in it) for tactical reasons **cannot later complain on appeal** that the same instruction was erroneous.  
  - Applied here because defense counsel:
    - Objected to the prosecutor’s proposed “caused danger to an animal’s life” language, and
    - Requested instead “created a high risk of death or great bodily injury to an animal,” explicitly to **increase the prosecution’s burden**.

- **Penal Code § 597(b)** (relevant portion summarized):  
  - Criminalizes (misdemeanor or felony) when a person:
    - **Deprives any animal** of necessary sustenance, drink, or shelter, or
    - **Causes** an animal to be so deprived, or
    - Having charge or custody of any animal, **subjects it to needless suffering**, or
    - **Fails to provide proper food, drink, shelter, or protection from the weather.**
  - Statute is written broadly; does not limit liability only to situations risking death.

- **Gross negligence in this context**  
  - Involves an act or omission that:
    - Recklessly exposes an animal to a **high risk of death** **or**  
    - Recklessly exposes an animal to a **high risk of great bodily injury** (holding of this case).

Key holdings / reasoning:
- **Invited error**:
  - Defense counsel *deliberately* sought language that added “high risk of death or great bodily injury,” knowing it increased the People’s burden.
  - Because of this tactical choice, the defendant is **barred from raising instructional error** based on that language.

- **Merits of the instructional issue (considered to avoid IAC claim)**:
  - Prior case **Speegle** approved an instruction that liability arises when a person commits an act or omission that “would inherently produce danger to an animal’s life.”
  - Speegle did **not** address whether liability extends to acts exposing an animal to a **high risk of great bodily injury**.
  - The court here holds: § 597(b) **does** allow criminal liability where grossly negligent conduct exposes an animal to a **high risk of great bodily injury**, not just death.
  - Reason: Nothing in the statute suggests the Legislature intended to punish only risks of death while giving a pass for grossly negligent conduct causing a high risk of serious (great bodily) injury.

Examples from the case:
- **Defense’s tactical request**:
  - Prosecutor’s proposed instruction: required proof defendant “caused danger to an animal’s life.”
  - Defense objection: argued gross negligence “requires something much more.”
  - Defense requested: proof defendant “created a high risk of death or great bodily injury to an animal.”
  - Prosecutor objected that this **increased** the prosecution’s burden—showing defense’s clear tactical purpose.

Pitfalls / common confusions:
- **Thinking you can challenge an instruction you asked for**:  
  - If defense counsel **knowingly and deliberately** requests specific language to gain an advantage, that generally **waives appellate claims** of error regarding that language (invited error).
- **Misreading § 597(b) as only about risk of death**:  
  - The statute’s language and this case’s holding confirm that **great bodily injury risk** is sufficient for criminal liability; it is not limited to life-threatening situations.
