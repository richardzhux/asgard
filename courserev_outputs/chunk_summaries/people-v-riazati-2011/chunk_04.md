# Chunk 04 (units 2461-3360)

Key concepts / sections
- Continued inspections of defendant’s property
  - March 15: follow-up visit (front yard only).
  - March 21–22: more extensive inspection, photos taken, pre-impoundment notice posted.
  - April 16: execution of search warrant, seizure of animals, conditions videotaped.

- Evidence of ongoing neglect (used to prove statutory violations)
  - Inadequate food, water, shelter.
  - Unsanitary conditions.
  - Failure to correct after warnings.

Details & examples (facts that support animal cruelty/neglect charges)

1. March 15 visit
- Officer Oliver returns alone; defendant not home.
- Could not access backyard or animals.
- Front yard condition essentially unchanged (clutter, odors).

2. March 21 visit
- Officer Oliver + another officer; photographs of front yard, backyard, and most of interior.
- Defendant admits he has not made many corrections; trying to sell one dog.
- Front yard slightly improved but still cluttered, with feces odor.
- Boxer dog still thin.

Birds (cockatiels, parakeets, finches)
- Birdcage issues:
  - Tray top as “shelter” was insufficient.
  - Water: brownish green, containing feces.
  - Food: not edible; feces in birdseed.
  - Overall poor sanitation due to amount of feces in cages.
  - No adequate shelter from extreme temperatures.
- Finches:
  - Kept in a fish tank.
  - Food and water contaminated with feces and urine.
  - Water brownish green.
- Cages stacked so upper birds defecate on birds below.

Rabbits & guinea pigs
- Approximately 20 rabbits in backyard; guinea pigs housed with them.
- Enclosure partly made of bales of hay; inadequate shelter from sun.
- Feces “everywhere”; poor sanitation.
- No visible rabbit food.
- Empty bowl with feces in it.
- Another container full of brownish water, too high for animals to reach.
- Odor of dead animal; officers find a dead young rabbit locked in a cage.

Other animals / areas
- Enclosed patio:
  - Some clutter cleared, but cages still present.
  - Hay and feces on floor.
- Living room and kitchen:
  - Multiple bird cages piled; feces from top cages fall onto lower birds.
  - Food and water contaminated with feces.
- Dogs:
  - Adult German Shepherd confined in backyard kennel.
  - Another dog apparently in a crate in a bedroom (heard, not necessarily seen).
- Chicken in backyard:
  - Inadequate shelter.
  - Contaminated food and water.

Officer action
- After inspection, defendant absent; Officer Oliver posts pre-impoundment notices on front door, listing needed corrections.

3. March 22 visit
- Defendant not home.
- Officer observes outdoor animals only.
- Slight improvement in water appearance for some birds (not as dark), but overall conditions unchanged.

4. April 16 – execution of search warrant
- Department obtains warrant to seize animals; multiple animal control and police officers assist.
- Execution recorded (photos and videotape admitted at trial).

Observed conditions (backyard, garage, house)
- General:
  - No significant change since prior visits.
  - Feces covering bottoms of cages.
- Rabbits & guinea pigs:
  - Backyard water bowls: brownish green, with feces.
  - Two rabbits found in garage:
    - Standing on wire flooring.
    - Tray below: saturated with urine and feces.
    - Water contaminated.
  - Another rabbit in kitchen cage:
    - Serious wounds on hindquarters (required immediate assessment by medical operations manager).
- Dogs:
  - Water container in backyard dog kennel:
    - Apparent bacterial growth; green water.
    - Larvae in a water bowl.
  - Dog food:
    - One bowl with old food.
    - Another with rotten-smelling food.
  - Three dogs found inside house.
    - One crated dog had dirty water, and the amount was insufficient.
- Birds:
  - Birds again found inside; only minimal or no improvement in conditions (continuing contamination and poor sanitation noted later in opinion).

Implied legal relevance / “definitions” in practice
- “Adequate” food, water, shelter, and “proper sanitation” are statutory requirements in animal-cruelty/neglect laws; here, the facts illustrate:
  - Inadequate shelter: birds (insufficient covers, exposure to temperature extremes), rabbits and chicken (no real sun or weather protection).
  - Inadequate water: brownish green, feces, bacteria, larvae; bowls unreachable; insufficient quantities.
  - Inadequate food: no visible rabbit food; bird food inedible or contaminated; rotten dog food.
  - Poor sanitation: pervasive feces in cages, trays saturated with urine/feces, strong odors, stacked cages causing defecation on lower animals.
  - Failure to remedy: repeated inspections, explicit instructions, and pre-impoundment notice, yet “no significant change.”

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Dates and progression:
  - Keep straight: March 15 (front yard only), March 21–22 (deeper inspections + pre-impoundment notice), April 16 (search warrant and seizure).
- “Some improvement” vs legal compliance:
  - Slightly clearer water or reduced clutter does not negate continuing statutory violations (conditions still grossly inadequate).
- Number and types of animals:
  - Multiple species (dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, chicken); neglect had to be evaluated species-by-species, but pattern is the same: food, water, shelter, sanitation all deficient.
