# Chunk 02 (units 821-1720)

**People v Riazati (2011) – Study Notes (Chunk 2/11)**

---

### Key Concepts / Sections

1. **Penal Code § 597(b) – Animal Neglect**
   - Statute at issue for both felony and misdemeanor animal neglect.
   - Applied to multiple species: rabbits, dogs (felony counts), and chickens, birds, guinea pigs, duck (misdemeanor counts).

2. **Issues on Appeal**
   - **Insufficiency of Evidence**
     - Claim: No evidence he failed to provide food, water, or shelter “in a manner that created a high risk of death,” so no **gross negligence** under § 597(b).
   - **Instructional Error**
     - Claim: Jury was told (at defendant’s own request) that guilt could be based on creating a **high risk of great bodily injury** (GBI), not only death, allegedly reducing the prosecution’s burden.

3. **Holdings (Legal Conclusions)**
   - **Invited Error Doctrine**
     - Defendant is **barred** from challenging the jury instructions because:
       - He **repeatedly requested** the specific instructions.
       - This was a **deliberate tactical choice** at trial.
   - **Instructions Correct as a Matter of Law**
     - Even if reviewed, court holds:
       - The instructions on:  
         (1) elements of § 597(b) animal neglect, and  
         (2) definition of **gross negligence**  
         were **legally correct**, including reference to high risk of great bodily injury.
   - **Sufficiency of Evidence**
     - The appellate court finds the **evidence sufficient** to support **all six convictions** under § 597(b).
   - **Result**: Judgment **affirmed**; convictions and restitution order stand.

### Definitions / Doctrines

1. **Animal Neglect (§ 597(b)) – Elements (as framed in opinion)**
   - Having care or custody of an animal.
   - **Failing to provide proper food, water, or shelter**.
   - Doing so with **gross negligence**, i.e., in a way that creates a **high risk** of:
     - Death, or
     - **Great bodily injury** (as clarified in the case).

2. **Gross Negligence (in criminal context)**
   - Higher standard than ordinary negligence.
   - Typically:  
     - Conduct that is **reckless** or **extremely careless**,  
     - creating a **high risk** to life or limb,  
     - and a reasonable person would have clearly recognized that risk.
   - Key for § 597(b): not just substandard care, but **high-risk** mistreatment/neglect.

3. **Invited Error**
   - A party **cannot complain on appeal** about trial error that:
     - They **requested**, **induced**, or **tactically sought**.
   - Applied here to:
     - The **jury instructions** on:
       - Animal neglect (§ 597(b));
       - Gross negligence including **high risk of great bodily injury**.

4. **Burden of Proof Concern**
   - Defendant argued allowing conviction based on high risk of GBI (rather than only death) **lowered the prosecution’s burden**.
   - Court rejected this:
     - High risk of **GBI** is a correct standard for **gross negligence** under § 597(b).

### Factual Examples (Evidence of Neglect)

**Timeline:** Department of Animal Services visits in **Feb–Apr 2008**; initial detailed visit on **February 28, 2008**.

- **General Property Conditions**
  - Over **90 animals** at the residence.
  - Front yard: “various items of junk,” holes filled with **stagnant water** with insects.
  - **Strong, foul odor** from yard and house.
  - Backyard: “random junk items” (e.g., old toilet), **very noticeable odor of feces and urine**; feces appeared to have **accumulated over time**.

- **Dog on Side Yard (Example of Neglect)**
  - Tethered **juvenile German Shepherd-type dog**:
    - **No shelter** from elements.
    - Lying in **muddy** area with insects.
    - **No access** to food or water observed.

- **Indoor/Enclosed Patio Animals**
  - Officer heard many **dogs barking** and **birds** inside.
  - Enclosed patio:
    - A **chicken** leaning its head against a glass door in an **unresponsive, atypical manner**.
    - Visible **rabbits and guinea pigs**.
    - Birds flying through vertical blinds into the area.
  - Strong **odor** from inside as well.

- **Licensing / Control Issues**
  - Five dogs present; no tags, only **one licensed**.
  - Officer tried to sell licenses; defendant became **argumentative and uncooperative**; issued a **correctable citation**.

These conditions form part of the **factual basis** for the jury’s finding of **gross negligence** in care (food/water/shelter) and for the appellate court’s **sufficiency-of-evidence** holding.

### Pitfalls / Common Confusions

1. **“Invited Error” vs. “Harmless Error”**
   - **Harmless error**: court decides whether an error affected outcome.
   - **Invited error**: if the party **requested** the error, appellate court generally will **not review** at all; no harmless-error analysis needed.

2. **Standard for Animal Neglect**
   - It’s not just **suboptimal** care.
   - Must rise to **gross negligence**:
     - Creating a **high risk of death or great bodily injury**, not just minor or speculative harm.

3. **Scope of § 597(b)**
   - Applies broadly across different **species**; the core question is **condition and risk** to the animals, not which species they are.

4. **“High Risk of Death” vs. “High Risk of Great Bodily Injury”**
   - Defendant argued only **death-risk** should count.
   - Court held **GBI-risk** is **sufficient** and consistent with criminal gross negligence standards; using GBI does **not** improperly reduce the prosecution’s
