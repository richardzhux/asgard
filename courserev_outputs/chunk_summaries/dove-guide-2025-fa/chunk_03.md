- Federal information: Assistant Regional Director – LE, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Atlanta, GA; see 50 CFR Part 20.

Common pitfalls / confusions
- Thinking own-property hunting or license exemption removes HIP or duck stamp requirements:  
  - HIP still required for all migratory bird/waterfowl hunters.  
  - Federal duck stamp still required for waterfowl hunters age 16+.
- Assuming Youth needs duck stamp/MB permit:  
  - Ages 12–15 need a hunting license but do NOT need Federal Duck Stamp or KY MB/Water
