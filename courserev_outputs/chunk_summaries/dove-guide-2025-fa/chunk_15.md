Examples (implicit)
- If a Jenny Hole hunter does not email check-in on Sunday → they have not met requirements and may lose their hunt opportunity.
- If a Sloughs WMA quota hunter skips the post-hunt survey → they lose eligibility at Sloughs for this and next waterfowl season.

Common pitfalls / confusions
- Thinking quota permits are transferable → they are NOT; the selected hunter must be present with their confirmation number.
- Assuming standby hunting is allowed at Sloughs or Mentor/Youth hunts → it is NOT.
- Forgetting survey deadlines (3 p.m. CST) at Sloughs/Jenny Hole; penalty is loss of eligibility for two seasons.
- Mis-timing entry: many WMAs prohibit entry before 4 a.m., even though shooting starts ½ hour before sunrise.
- Attempting scouting on Jenny Hole outside permit dates → specifically prohibited.
- Misreading closures at South Shore: area is “closed” but still allows dove and waterfowl during the closure period.
