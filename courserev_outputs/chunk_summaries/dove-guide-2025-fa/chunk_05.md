Definitions / rules

Shooting hours
- Dove, private land:
  - Sept 1 only: 11 a.m. to sunset
  - Remainder of season: ½ hour before sunrise to sunset

Protected species
- King rail: Protected, cannot be hunted in Kentucky.

Daily bag vs possession limit
- Daily bag limit: Max birds taken in one calendar day (midnight–midnight).
- Possession limit: Total birds in hunter’s possession after 2+ days of hunting (at home or in transport).
- Does NOT allow more than the daily limit while actively hunting in the field.

Licenses & permits
- Unless exempt:
  - Must have a valid Kentucky hunting license to hunt species in this guide.
- Kentucky Migratory Bird/Waterfowl Hunting Permit:
  - Required to hunt all migratory game birds including waterfowl (ducks, geese, coots, mergansers).
- Federal duck stamp:
  - Required in addition to hunting license and KY Migratory Bird/Waterfowl Permit for waterfowl hunting.
- Not required for crows: KY Migratory Bird/Waterfowl Permit and federal duck stamp.
- HIP (Harvest Information Program):
  - Must complete HIP survey online each year before hunting migratory birds.
  - Access via “My Profile” at fw.ky.gov.
  - Receive a confirmation number; must be written on hunting license or Migratory Bird/Waterfowl Permit.

Non-toxic shot
- Only USFWS‑approved non-toxic shot may be possessed/used for doves, gallinules, rails, woodcock, snipe, or other migratory birds on:
  - Ballard, Boatwright, Doug Travis, Duck Island, Kaler Bottoms, Kentucky River, Ohio River Islands, Sloughs, South Shore, Yatesville Lake WMAs, Clarks River NWR, and other posted areas.
- Statewide:
  - Possession or use of any lead shot is prohibited while hunting or attempting to take waterfowl or sandhill cranes.
  - Non-toxic shot required for all waterfowl hunting.
- Approved shot types list: see USFWS link (https://go.usa.gov/xSUvE).

Dove-specific notes
- Eurasian collared dove vs mourning dove:
  - Eurasian collared dove: black slash on back of neck.
  - No bag limit on Eurasian collared doves, but keep head and/or wing attached during transport for identification.
- Because species ID in flight is difficult:
  - Hunters should stop shooting after reaching 15-bird limit of mourning and/or white-winged doves (even though Eurasian collared has no limit).

Sandhill crane season (quota hunt)
- Application:
  - Online only at fw.ky.gov.
  - Applications accepted only in September.
  - $3 application fee.
  - Must have valid KY hunting license or be license exempt at time of application.
- Tags:
  - Depending on number of applicants, hunters may receive 1–3 tags.
  - One bird per tag.
- Requirements:
  - Must pass a species identification test before receiving a permit.
  - Drawn hunters must pass an online ID exam before receiving permit.
  - Hunters must print permit and tags from sandhill crane webpage.
  - Must telecheck harvested birds on the day taken.
  - Must complete a post-season survey or will not be eligible for a sandhill crane permit the following season.

Transport & import of migratory birds
- One fully feathered wing must remain attached to all migratory game birds being transported between:
  - Port of entry and home, OR
  - Port of entry and migratory bird preservation facility.
- Import from foreign countries:
  - Cannot import migratory game birds killed in a foreign country (other than Canada) unless:
    - Birds are dressed and drawn,
    - Head and feet removed (except where 50 CFR 20.63 requires otherwise).
  - Cannot import migratory game birds that belong to another person.

Dual violation
- Violating Kentucky migratory game bird regulations is also a violation of federal regulations.

Public land hunting for doves
- All public dove fields:
  - Closed to all access from Aug 15 until sunrise on Sept 1.
- Decoy restrictions on public dove fields:
  - Use of decoys (motorized or static) is prohibited before Oct 1.
- Finding fields:
  - Public dove fields list via QR code or by searching “dove fields” at fw.ky.gov.

Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs)
- Generally open during regular seasons under statewide regulations unless otherwise specified in the guide.

Examples (implicit)
- HIP: A hunter planning to hunt dove must complete the HIP survey, then write the HIP confirmation number on their license before hunting.
- Possession limit: After two days of hunting within legal daily limits, a hunter may have multiple birds in the freezer, but still cannot exceed the daily limit in the field on any one day.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming possession limit lets you carry more than the daily bag while hunting—this is NOT allowed.
- Forgetting HIP: Having a license and permits is not enough; HIP survey & confirmation are required to be legal.
- Using lead shot on:
  - Any waterfowl or sandhill crane (illegal statewide).
  - Listed WMAs/NWRs for migratory birds where non-toxic is required.
- Misidentifying Eurasian collared doves and continuing to shoot after taking 15 mourning/white-winged doves.
- Entering public dove fields between Aug 15 and sunrise Sept 1, or using decoys on those fields before Oct 1.
- Not keeping a fully feathered wing attached when transporting migratory game birds from out of country to home or preservation facility.
