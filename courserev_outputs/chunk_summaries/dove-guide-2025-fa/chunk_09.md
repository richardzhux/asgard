Pitfalls / Common Confusions

- Assuming permanent blinds are allowed everywhere: only where specifically permitted or for certain drawn/assigned sites.
- Forgetting daily removal of decoys and temporary blinds.
- Overlooking the 1-hour-before-sunrise rule: drawn blinds become open to others if not occupied by then.
- Misunderstanding youth/military rules:
  - Adults cannot hunt during November youth-only days, but can hunt geese during February youth days.
  - Guard/reserve must be on active duty to qualify as “active-duty” for these hunts.
- Relying on the old bird band phone reporting system: must use the website now.
- Treating Ballard WMA like a normal WMA: it has strict quota-only waterfowl access and multiple closed days.
