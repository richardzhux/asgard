### 1. Reporting Bird Bands for Waterfowl

- **Change in reporting method**
  - Reporting band numbers by phone is no longer used.
  - All bird band reports must now be submitted online at: **www.reportband.gov**.
  - Toll-free numbers printed on older bands will only redirect you to the website.
  - Bands may show an address and/or old toll-free number, but you should still report only via the website.

- **Purpose of band reporting**
  - Migratory bird biologists use band data to:
    - Assess **harvest rates**
    - Track **bird movement**
    - Estimate **survival**
  - Managers use this information to:
    - Set **season dates**
    - Set **bag limits**
    - Determine **season lengths**

**Pitfalls / Confusions**
- Thinking the toll-free number is still valid for reporting.
- Ignoring bands that show an address or old phone number instead of going to the website.

### 2. HIP Migratory Bird Survey

- **Requirement**
  - If you hunt **doves, ducks, or any other migratory birds**, you **must complete a HIP Migratory Bird Survey** before hunting.

- **How to complete**
  - Go to **fw.ky.gov/myprofile** (My Profile page on FW.KY.GOV).
  - Log into your **My Profile** account.
  - Can also access via QR code (as shown in the document).

**Pitfalls / Confusions**
- Believing HIP is optional: it is **required** before hunting migratory birds.
- Forgetting to complete HIP each season when you plan to hunt migratory species.
