Common pitfalls / confusions

- Thinking you can shoot depredating crows anytime:
  - Now requires specific federal authorization outside open seasons.
- Using the old bird-band phone number:
  - Must report online at reportband.gov, even if band shows phone number.
- Scouting dove fields by walking in before Sept. 1:
  - Illegal from Aug. 15 until sunrise Sept. 1; must scout from road/parking.
- Ignoring post-season survey for sandhill cranes:
  - Failure to complete survey by Feb. 14 makes you ineligible to apply next year.
- Assuming all of a WMA is open to migratory birds:
  - Some entire blocks or sub-areas are closed (e.g., main block of Robinson Forest, specific parts of Grayson and Yatesville Lakes, LBL Sept. 30–Nov. 30).
- Woodcock hunting:
  - Completely prohibited on Ballard WMA, Swan Lake portion of Boatwright WMA, and Miller Welch-CKY WMA.
- Mentor/Youth hunts:
  - Adult must have a youth; capacity limited; time window
