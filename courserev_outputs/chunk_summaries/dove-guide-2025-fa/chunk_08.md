Definitions / rules

1. Nontoxic shot

  - Waterfowl
  - Sandhill cranes  
- Lead shot and any non‑approved shot are prohibited statewide for these species.
- USFWS nontoxic list: see federal website noted in text.

2. Youth-only & veteran/military-only waterfowl seasons (statewide)
- Youth-only dates:
  - Saturday before Thanksgiving: Nov. 22, 2025
  - Second Saturday in February: Feb. 14, 2026
- Veteran/active‑duty dates:

  - Second Sunday in February: Feb. 8, 2026
- Eligibility for veteran/active‑duty days:

  - Valid KY hunting license
  - KY migratory bird/waterfowl permit
  - Signed, current federal duck stamp

3. HIP (Harvest Information Program) survey
- Required each year before dove or waterfowl hunting.
- Done through fw.ky.gov under “My Profile”.

4. September Canada Goose season
- Two zones:
  - Western Zone: Sept. 1–15 (blue‑shaded counties on map)
  - Eastern Zone: Sept. 16–30 (all other counties)
- Closed areas during September goose season:
  1) Cave Run Lake
  2) Ballard Zone public lands (private lands open; public lands closed)
  3) West Kentucky WMA (completely closed to Sept. goose)
- “Areas manipulated for dove hunting”:
  - Not legal for waterfowl hunting (important baiting/boundary issue).

5. Cave Run Lake Goose Closure Area
- No goose hunting on:
  - Boone Forest and water within boundaries of KY 801, KY 1274, KY 36, KY 211, KY 60, KY 826.
- Includes most of Cave Run Lake.

6. Ballard Zone boundary (for waterfowl regs)
- Described by:
  - NW city limits of Wickliffe → middle of Mississippi River
  - North along Mississippi → low water mark of Ohio River (Illinois shore) → Ballard–McCracken Co. line
  - Along Ballard–McCracken line south → KY 358
  - South on KY 358 → US 60 at LaCenter
  - US 60 SW → NE city limits of Wickliffe

7. Blind spacing and shotgun rule (Ballard Zone context)
- All blinds (including boats) must be:
  - ≥ 100 yards apart from each other
  - ≥ 50 yards from any property line
- A waterfowl hunter may not:
  - Possess more than one uncased or loaded shotgun while in the blind.

8. Public land waterfowl hunting / season-long blinds
- Season‑long hunting blinds available at:
  - Barkley Lake
  - Barren River Lake
  - Doug Travis WMA
  - Green River Lake
- Permit / registration:
  - Hunt sites must be registered on a permit from USACE or KY Fish & Wildlife before blind construction.
  - One permit per area per applicant.
  - Applicant may designate one partner.
- Construction & removal:
  - Blinds/hunt sites must be constructed by Nov. 20.
  - Must be removed within 30 days after the close of the season.
  - Failure to remove → loss of eligibility for a blind the following year.
- Use by others:
  - Permittees may not lock blinds to prevent use by others when permittee is absent.
- Drawings for hunt sites:
  - Areas: Barkley, Barren River, Doug Travis, Green River Lake WMAs.
  - Held August–October.
  - Applicants must:
    - Be ≥ 18 years old
    - Show valid KY hunting license
    - Show KY waterfowl permit
    - Show federal migratory bird (duck) stamp
  - Each person drawn may select one partner; partner must be present at the drawing.
  - Drawn hunters may:
    - Use their site entire season
    - Use a boat, portable blind, or construct a permanent blind
    - Must mark site with permanent marker listing permit holders.
  - If drawn hunters do not occupy blind/hunt site by 1 hour before sunrise, it becomes available for others that day (sentence cuts off but this is standard practice).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Using lead shot or non‑approved shot for waterfowl/sandhill cranes is illegal even if not actually firing.
- Forgetting HIP survey: required every year before dove or waterfowl hunting.
- Misusing dove‑manipulated fields: legal for doves, not for waterfowl.
- Assuming all Ballard Zone is closed in September: only public lands; private lands are open (but must still obey other rules).
- Locking a season‑long blind to keep others out when you’re not there is prohibited.
- Not removing blinds after the season → loss of blind privilege next year.
