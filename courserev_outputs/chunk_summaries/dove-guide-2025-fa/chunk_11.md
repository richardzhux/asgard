**Common Pitfalls / Confusions**

- **Boatwright**:
  - Forgetting that **all** regular duck hunts (including Thanksgiving week) are now quota-only.
  - Arriving after 4:45 a.m. CT and losing your online-reserved spot.
  - Trying to apply as standby at **both** Ballard and Boatwright for the same day (not allowed).
  - Boating on non-quota days after Dec 1, or staying on water past 2 p.m.
  - Leaving decoys/gear in place overnight (prohibited).

- **Time & Entry Rules**:
  - At Cedar Creek, Clear Creek, and Dix River WMAs: entry not allowed before 4 a.m., and shooting must stop by 2 p.m.

- **Area Closures**:
  - Misjudging boundaries for **no-goose** zone at Cave Run Lake.
  - Overlooking seasonal closed portions at Doug Travis (signed areas Nov 1–Mar 15) and Boatwright (signed areas Oct 15–Mar 15).
