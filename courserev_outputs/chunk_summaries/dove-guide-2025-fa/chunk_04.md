Definitions & rules

**Unlawful hunting methods**
- From motorboats/sailboats: illegal unless motor fully off and/or sail furled and movement has completely ceased.
- Live decoys: illegal. Tame/captive ducks or geese must be:
  - Removed 10 consecutive days before hunting, and  
  - Confined so their calls are muffled and they are fully hidden from sight of migratory waterfowl.
- Electronic calls: illegal (records/tapes/amplified bird calls),  
  - Exception: electronic calls allowed during Snow Goose Conservation Order.
- Driving/rallying birds: illegal to use motor-driven land/water/air vehicles or sailboats to push birds into range.
- Baiting: illegal to hunt:
  - By placing feed (corn, wheat, salt, etc.) as lure/enticement, or  
  - On/over any baited area.
  - Area remains “baited” for **10 days after bait removal**.
- Legal for doves: mature wildlife food plots grown to attract doves are legal **if no extra attractants added**.
- Dove vs waterfowl: areas manipulated for dove hunting are **not legal** for waterfowl.
- Feeding livestock / grain storage areas: hunting over areas where livestock are fed or grain is stored (bins, elevators) is prohibited.

**Closed season**
- No taking of migratory game birds during closed season.

**Shooting hours**
- Birds may only be taken during legal shooting hours (species- and area-specific; details for dove below).

**Limits**
- **Daily bag limit**: max number of a species that can be taken in **one calendar day** during legal hours, regardless of crossing state lines.
- **Field possession limit**: may not possess more than one daily bag limit:
  - While in the field, or  
  - While returning from field to car, camp, home, etc.
- **Possession limit**: total number of a species you can have **in your possession at any time**, anywhere (on you, at home, taxidermist, etc.).
  - Birds taken in another state count toward both daily and possession limits.

**Wanton waste**
- All migratory game birds must be retrieved if possible and kept in hunter’s custody in the field.

**Tagging**
- Required when leaving birds at any place or with another person, including:
  - Transport by another person, cleaning, storage (even temporary), shipment, taxidermy.
- Tag must include:
  - Hunter’s signature  
  - Hunter’s address  
  - Total number of birds, by species  
  - Dates birds were killed

**Possession of live birds**
- Wounded birds reduced to possession must be **immediately killed** and count in daily bag limit.

**Field dressing / identification**
- When preparing species in this guide (except doves) for transport:
  - Leave **one fully feathered wing OR the head** attached to each bird for identification.
  - Doves are exempt from this requirement.

**Shipment**
- To ship migratory game birds, package must be marked outside with:
  - Name and address of sender
