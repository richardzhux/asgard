### Quota Hunts & Preference Points

- If you **do not comply** with quota hunt requirements:
  - You are **ineligible** to apply for **any** quota hunt the **following year** (deer, pheasant, waterfowl, etc.).
  - You **lose all accumulated preference points**.
- To **keep** preference points each year:
  - You must either:
    - **Apply for a quota hunt**, or
    - Apply for the **“do not hunt” option**.
- Preference points:
  - If **unsuccessful** in the drawing **or** you applied for the **do not hunt** option → you get **1 preference point**.
  - You can earn **only 1 point per hunt species per year**.

**Pitfalls**

- Skipping application entirely (including “do not hunt”) causes **loss of points**.
- Violating quota requirements (e.g., failing to show up or follow rules) costs you **next year’s eligibility** and **points**.

### Access, Terrain & Safety (Waterfowl Units)

- Habitat: natural depressions / “sloughs” with shrubby cover and trees.
- Recommended gear: **chest waders** (water on all units).
- Hazards: woody vegetation, beaver runs, rapid changes in elevation.
- **Mississippi River levels** (Cairo, IL gauge):
  - Above **35 ft**: possible **loss of road access** to some WMA areas.
  - Above **41 ft**: typically **Berkley–Fish Lake Road is cut off at both ends**, requiring a **boat** to access most of area.
