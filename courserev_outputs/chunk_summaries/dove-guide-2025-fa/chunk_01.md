**Key Concepts / Sections**

- **Bird Flu (HPAI) Precautions for Waterfowl Hunters**
  - Disease can be carried by migrating waterfowl; can sicken/kill other birds (incl. chickens).
  - Human risk is considered low, but flu‑like symptoms after handling birds should be reported to a healthcare provider.
  - Main transmission: **saliva, mucus, feces** from infected birds.

- **Handling and Processing Wild Birds**
  - **Field dress outside / well‑ventilated area.**
  - Wear **gloves**; avoid direct handling of entrails.
  - **Do not**:
    - Feed carcasses to dogs.
    - Allow dogs to handle birds beyond retrieving.
  - “**Breasting out**” birds (taking breast meat only) is the safest prep.
  - **Identification rule:** when transporting waterfowl, each bird must retain **a wing or head** attached for species identification.

- **Hygiene / Cleanliness**
  - Hunters can spread the virus via contaminated hands, tools, or surfaces.
  - Do not **eat, drink, or smoke** while cleaning game.
  - Wash hands with **soap and warm water** after handling birds.
  - Disinfect all surfaces and tools that contact carcasses; use **dedicated tools** for cleaning game.

- **Cooking Wild Game**
  - Cook all game to **internal temperature of 165°F**.
  - Properly cooked game is considered safe to eat.

- **Protecting Domestic / Farm Birds**
  - Don’t wear **hunting clothes and boots** around domestic birds.
  - If domestic birds may have avian influenza, call **KY Dept. of Agriculture Sick Bird Hotline: 866‑536‑7593**.

- **Disposal of Carcasses**
  - Double‑bag for regular garbage pickup **or** bury deeply enough that scavengers cannot dig them up.

- **Reporting Sick or Dead Birds**
  - Don’t handle birds found already dead in the field.
  - Avoid shooting birds that look sick or behave oddly (unsteady, acting strange).
  - Report:
    - Dead or diseased wild birds:  
      **https://fw.ky.gov/Wildlife/Pages/AvianInfluenza.aspx**
    - Clusters of dead/sick birds: via online reporting at **fw.ky.gov** (search “avian influenza”).

- **About the Kentucky Migratory Bird & Waterfowl Guide**
  - It is a **summary only**; not the full legal text of Kentucky statutes (KRS) and regulations (KAR).
  - Full regulation text available at **fw.ky.gov** → *Enforcement* → *Regulations* → *Administrative Regulations*.
  - **Changes from last season** are printed in **bright blue** in the guide.

**Common Pitfalls / Confusions**

- Forgetting the **wing/head attachment requirement** on transported waterfowl (needed for species ID).
- Using **decoys on public dove fields before Oct. 1**—now explicitly prohibited.
- Applying for **both** Ballard and Boatwright standby hunts on the same day—not allowed.
- Assuming the guide is the **full legal text**; it is a summary, so detailed legal questions require checking KRS/KAR online.
