# Chunk 02 (units 821-1720)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Childhood at Frank’s Landing**
    - River-centered life: swimming, rope swings, diving off the old wooden “Old Road” bridge.
    - Frank’s Landing as a **social hub** for Indian and non-Indian (farmers’) children.
    - Regular trips to **Nisqually Reach** (where the Nisqually River meets Puget Sound).
    - Abundance of wildlife: eagles, ducks, geese, white swans; plentiful oysters, clams, and flounder (caught by wading and feeling with feet).
    - Kids tracked **annual changes in the river**—meandering, logjams, searching for cedar logs to make canoes.

  - **Early criminalization of Indian fishing**
    - In 1935, when Billy Frank Jr. was four, his father was first arrested for **“illegal” fishing**:
      - Targeted because Indians weren’t getting **state licenses** or following **state seasons/take-limits**, even though they had treaty rights.
      - This marks the beginning of systematic **state enforcement against Indian fishers**.

  - **Post–World War II transformation of the region**
    - **Economic expansion:**
      - Boeing as economic anchor in Puget Sound (military aircraft, then commercial jets).
      - Growth of **electronics, aerospace, and international trade**.
    - **Population boom:**
      - Washington’s population: ~2.3 million at end of WWII → nearly 6 million by end of 20th century.
      - Puget Sound area: ~1 million (1945) → 3.3 million (late 1990s).
    - **Suburbanization:** driven by appeal of clean air and outdoor lifestyle.

  - **Growth of agriculture and timber**
    - **Irrigated agriculture** (Yakima, Wenatchee valleys, etc.) enabled huge crops of apples, pears, and specialty fruits.
    - **Timber harvests** on national forests:
      - By 1965, harvests were **11× prewar levels**, heavily degrading salmon habitat.
    - Private timber companies intensified logging practices.

  - **Explosion of non-Indian fishing**
    - **Commercial fishing:**
      - Puget Sound gillnetters (sockeye): 46 (1945) → 322 (1953) → 637 (1957).
      - Seiners: 121 (1945) → 452 (1961).
      - Commercial license: ~$15/year with **no daily catch limit**.
    - **Sport fishing:**
      - 2-fish daily limit for salmon.
      - Many “sport” fishers claimed to be commercial to exploit the loose regulations.
    - State attention focused on Indian “violations,” even as **non-Indian fishing pressure soared**.

  - **Environmental impacts & salmon decline**
    - **Nisqually spring chinook run**:
      - Once the largest and best-tasting, began to decline in late 1940s.
      - Causes:
        - **Unregulated offshore commercial boats**.
        - **Hydroelectric dams** and projects (Tacoma, Centralia) on the upper Nisqually.
    - **Hydropower and development:**
      - Short, steep rivers ideal for **hydroelectric generation** to fuel regional growth.
      - Dams heavily damaged salmon runs on the Nisqually.
    - **Habitat destruction:**
      - Logging practices (roads, erosion, sediment).
      - Urban/suburban expansion, road and highway building.
      - **Chemicals**: 2,4-D and other pesticides from forestry and agriculture entering rivers.

- **Key definitions / terms**

  - **Nisqually Reach**: The estuarine area where the Nisqually River flows into Puget Sound.
  - **Gillnetter**: A commercial fishing vessel using gillnets—vertical nets in the water column that entangle fish by their gills.
  - **Seiner**: A fishing boat using seine nets, which encircle and trap schools of fish.
  - **Hydroelectric project**: Dams and related infrastructure harnessing river flow to generate electricity; often block or alter fish habitat and migration routes.

- **Examples**

  - **Example of former abundance**: Children easily catching flounders by wading and feeling them with their feet; plentiful oysters, clams, and diverse birdlife along the Reach.
  - **Example of regulatory imbalance**: Indians arrested for not having state licenses or obeying state seasons, while non-Indian commercial effort and sport pressure dramatically increased under lenient license and catch rules.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **“Illegal fishing” vs. treaty rights**:
    - The state called Indian fishing “illegal” according to **state** rules, but tribes had preexisting **treaty-reserved rights**. The conflict is legal and political, not simple lawbreaking.
  - **Cause of salmon decline**:
    - Not primarily Indian subsistence fishing; driven by:
      - Industrial-scale **commercial and sport fishing**.
      - **Dams**, logging, agriculture, urbanization, and pollution.
  - **“Clean outdoor lifestyle” vs. environmental damage**:
    - The same postwar migration and development that sought nature and recreation also **intensified habitat destruction** and pollution that harmed salmon and rivers.
