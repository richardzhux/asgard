# Chunk 09 (units 6561-7460)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Escalation of treaty fishing conflict**
    - 1964: After six fishermen were jailed for contempt, a **resistance organization** forms.
    - Frank’s Landing becomes a focal point; “**fish‑ins**” on the Nisqually River are a direct‑action tactic to assert treaty rights.

  - **Strategic goals of tribes regarding treaties**
    - Establish three core points:
      1. **Freedom from state regulation**: Tribal fishers can fish under treaty rights, not state law.
      2. **Sovereign regulatory authority**: Tribes regulate fishing on reservations and at treaty off‑reservation sites.
      3. **Right to a substantial share of fish runs**: Not just the right to fish, but to take a meaningful **allocation** of the harvestable fish.

  - **Columbia River litigation – Sohappy v. Smith / United States v. Oregon (1968–69)**
    - Trigger: Arrest of Yakama fishermen **Richard and David Sohappy** for gillnet fishing.
    - Hank Adams secures support (including a small NAACP grant); law professor Ralph Johnson and others file suit.
    - **Sohappy v. Smith** (individual Yakama fishers vs. Oregon official) is consolidated with **United States v. Oregon** (federal government intervenes on tribes’ side).
    - Judge **Robert C. Belloni** (U.S. District Court, Portland) issues the 1969 decision:
      - Affirms the **validity of the treaties**.
      - Confirms tribes have **special, federally guaranteed rights** that override conflicting state law.
      - Recognizes a tribal right to an **allocation** of the fish runs, expressed as a **“fair share”** of the **harvestable** salmon.

  - **“Harvestable” and “fair share”**
    - **Harvestable salmon**: The portion of a salmon run that can be caught by Indian and non‑Indian fishers **after leaving sufficient “escapement”** (enough fish to spawn and sustain the run).
    - **“Fair share”**: Belloni’s term for the tribal allocation; crucially:
      - It acknowledges tribes are entitled to a quantifiable share, not just token access.
      - But the decision **does not specify a percentage** (e.g., 5%, 33%, 50%), leaving “fair” undefined and guaranteeing future litigation.

  - **Shift to United States v. Washington (1970)**
    - After Sohappy, the **United States doubles down** on a strong tribal rights position.
    - 1970: U.S. files **United States v. Washington** on behalf of the **Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula tribes** that signed the **Stevens Treaties**.
    - New dynamic: The **federal government’s prestige, lawyers, and funding** now back tribes like the Nisqually.
      - Key federal lawyer: **George Dysart**, long dedicated to Indian causes.
      - Federal funding pays for expert **historians, anthropologists, and biologists** to reconstruct treaty context and support tribal claims.

  - **Native American Rights Fund (NARF) and tribal legal teams**
    - Activists **Hank Adams** and **Janet McCloud (Tulalip)** seek help from **NARF**, a new national Indian law firm.
    - Rationale: Tribes need their **own lawyers** alongside federal attorneys (who act as trustee for the tribes but are not directly controlled by them).
    - **David Getches**, NARF’s executive director, becomes lead counsel for many tribes.
    - Local legal services programs (e.g., Seattle lawyers **John Sennhauser, Michael Taylor, David Allen**) also support Indian communities.

- **Definitions**

  - **Treaty fishing rights**: Rights reserved by tribes in 19th‑century treaties (e.g., Stevens Treaties) to fish at “usual and accustomed places,” often off‑reservation, which are:
    - Federal law,
    - Superior to conflicting state regulations.
  - **Sovereign tribal authority**: Tribes as governments, not just interest groups, with regulatory power over tribal members and tribal resources.
  - **Harvestable portion**: The amount of a fish run that can be legally caught while ensuring enough fish escape to spawn.
  - **Escapement**: The number of fish that escape harvest and reach spawning grounds to sustain future runs.
  - **Fair share (Belloni)**: Judicial term for the portion of the harvestable fish that must be reserved for treaty tribes; conceptually significant but numerically undefined in 1969.

- **Examples from the text**

  - **Direct‑action example**: 
    - 1966 Nisqually “fish‑in”: State wardens remove all surface nets; in response, Billy Frank uses a **submerged “sinker” net** and successfully lands four steelhead, demonstrating ongoing treaty fishing despite enforcement.
  - **Litigation example**:
    - **Sohappy v. Smith / U.S. v. Oregon**: First major modern federal case to:
      - Confirm tribal rights are special, treaty‑based, and outside state control.
      - Introduce the **“fair share” allocation** concept.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **“Right to fish” vs. “right to fish without limits”**
    - Tribes do not claim a right to ignore all regulation; they claim:
      - Freedom from **state** regulation,
      - Subject instead to **tribal** and **federal** constraints, including conservation and escapement.
  - **Meaning of “fair share”**
    - Not a fixed 50/50 in this ruling—Belloni doesn’t set a number.
    - The vagueness is intentional/inevitable at this stage and leaves room for further conflict (later addressed in cases like U.S. v. Washington/Boldt).
  - **Scope of the dispute**
    - Not limited to the Nisqually/Puyallup:
      - Involves **Stevens treaty tribes** across WA, OR, ID, MT.
      - Similar conflicts in **Northern California** and the **Great Lakes**.
    - It’s both a local civil‑rights struggle (Frank’s Landing, fish‑ins) and a **national treaty‑rights and federalism** issue.
