# Chunk 16 (units 12301-12908)

Key concepts / sections
- Personal losses and stability
  - In 1977, Billy Frank Jr. lost his daughter Maureen and granddaughter Cabaqhud in a car accident.
  - Friends (e.g., Hank Adams) worried this might trigger a relapse into alcoholism, but it did not.
  - Shows Billy’s resilience and personal discipline after earlier struggles with alcohol.

- Relationships and family
  - Met lawyer Sue Crystal (protégée of law professor Ralph Johnson and assistant to Senator Warren Magnuson) around this time.
  - Billy and first wife Norma separated but stayed close until her death in 1987; Billy remained protective and caring toward her.
  - Billy and Sue built a close family life; son Willie born in 1982.
  - Sue describes being with Billy as “like floating on a steady, easy river” – his life is turbulent, but his demeanor is calm and peaceful.
  - Photo description: three generations at Frank’s Landing (1982):
    - Willie Frank Sr. (Qui-Lash-Kut), 103
    - Billy Frank Jr. (Kluck-et-suh), 51
    - Infant Willie (Qui-Lash-Kut), 6 months
  - Naming tradition: grandson is named for grandfather; Billy will pass his name to his firstborn grandson, continuing the Qui-Lash-Kut / Kluck-et-suh lineage.

- Cultural teaching and gender respect
  - Billy quietly teaches his son:
    - how to treat people
    - how to treat the earth
    - how to treat women (highlighted as especially important by Sue).
  - Emphasizes intergenerational transfer of “Indian values” rather than only legal or political training.

- Aftermath of the Boldt Decision
  - Boldt decision confirmed tribal treaty rights to salmon (earlier in the book); here, focus shifts from winning rights to implementing them.
  - Billy sees “a lot of new things to do” after Boldt:
    - Federal funding for tribal fisheries management.
    - Ability to hire technical experts and “do it right.”
    - Period described as exciting and full of possibility.

- Tribal fisheries institutions and management
  - Guy McMinds (Quinault) and Dutch Kinley (Lummi) founded an intertribal fish commission for Washington tribes.
  - Vision: blend Indian values with expert fisheries management at a regional scale.
  - Problem context:
    - Nisqually and other watersheds had been “wrecked.”
    - Treaty rights are meaningless if salmon runs continue to decline.
  - Opportunity:
    - Tribes know the watersheds better than anyone.
    - With rights confirmed, they could move from conflict to cooperative management.
    - Tribal rights might become a “galvanizing force” against destructive development.
    - Tribes could lead efforts to save salmon, not just demand access to them.

- Continuity of teachings and activism
  - Billy’s patience and persistence on the river are linked to lessons from his father.
  - Now aims to apply traditional teachings about treating rivers and land within formal management structures.
  - Marks a shift from direct action/protest to institution-building and long-term resource stewardship.

Definitions / key ideas (in context)
- Boldt Decision: A landmark federal court ruling affirming that Washington tribes have a right to up to 50% of harvestable fish in their usual and accustomed places, based on treaty language. In this section, it is the foundation for new tribal management authority and funding.
- Intertribal fish commission: A cooperative body formed by multiple tribes to coordinate fisheries management, blend traditional knowledge with scientific expertise, and negotiate with state/federal entities.

Examples from the text
- Example of intergenerational teaching: Billy instructing his son Willie on behavior toward people, earth, and women.
- Example of rights-to-responsibility transition: tribes using Boldt-confirmed rights plus federal funds to hire technical staff and manage fisheries themselves.
- Example of naming and lineage continuity: repeating ancestral names (Qui-Lash-Kut, Kluck-et-suh) across generations to maintain identity and responsibility.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing “winning rights” with “solving the problem”:
  - Boldt affirmed rights, but did not by itself restore salmon runs or healthy rivers.
  - The text stresses that rights without conservation and sound management are hollow.
- Viewing treaty rights as only about access:
  - Here, rights are framed as a tool to protect ecosystems and shape development, not just to catch fish.
- Overlooking tribal leadership in environmental policy:
  - Non-Native narratives may frame tribes mainly as litigants or protesters.
  - This section emphasizes tribes as managers, technical experts, and moral leaders in river and salmon protection.
- Personal vs. political Billy Frank:
  - It’s easy to see only the public activist; this passage underlines his roles as father, partner, cultural teacher, and bearer of a lineage, which inform his later policy work.
