# Chunk 03 (units 1641-2540)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Post–WWII environmental changes**
    - By 1965, **timber harvests on national forests** were ~**11× prewar levels** → major damage to salmon habitat.
    - **Private timber companies** intensified logging on their own lands.
    - **Urban/suburban development** (especially roads and highways) degraded watersheds.
    - **Chemical pollution**: pesticides like **2,4-D** used in forestry & agriculture entered rivers.
    - Result: salmon once “clean and healthy” declined sharply:
      - 1960 **non‑Indian commercial Chinook catch** was **less than half** of 1940s levels.
      - Other salmon species also declined or worse.

  - **State enforcement vs. Nisqually fishermen**
    - Earlier **sporadic arrests** (e.g., Billy’s in 1945) escalated in the 1960s into a **“relentless” enforcement campaign**.
    - State officers viewed treaty fishermen as:
      - **Renegades** flouting “sensible” conservation law.
      - A **main cause** of salmon run collapse.
    - Later finding (Judge Boldt, 1974): **Indian fishermen had not wasted fish or harmed runs**.
    - However, in the 1960s, officers treated it as a **holy crusade** with “no quarter.”

  - **Billy Frank Jr.’s early life & work**
    - Schooling:
      - Nisqually Grade School (two-room building near Frank’s Landing).
      - Lacey Grade School, junior high in Olympia.
      - **Formal education ended after 9th grade.**
    - Community changes:
      - The small wayside town “Nisqually” (mail & groceries) **disappeared with Interstate-5 construction in 1968**.
    - Work:
      - Fished from a **canoe**, sold salmon; faced **occasional arrests and confiscations**.
      - Took **construction jobs** via AFL Union Hall despite no union card; worked on roads and sewer systems.
    - Military:
      - Joined **U.S. Marines in 1952**, served two years.
      - Took pride in discipline and physical conditioning.
      - Returned to Frank’s Landing, fishing, and construction afterward.

  - **Formation of an activist**
    - Surface biography (school, jobs, military) does **not fully explain** activism.
    - Emphasis on **internal factors not on a résumé**:
      - **Rage at history and the present**.
      - Sense that **Leschi’s spirit** (historic Nisqually leader executed in 1850s) “lives on” in Billy.
    - Suggests a **spiritual and emotional continuity** between past injustices and present activism.

  - **1964 river episode (setup to a famous confrontation)**
    - Billy recalls fishing on the Nisqually with **Al Bridges** in fall 1964, in a **canoe made by Johnny Bobb**.
    - Hints at coming incident: **wardens later rammed and capsized Billy’s canoe; Al was arrested too.**
    - Anecdote about **Johnny Bobb**:
      - Built simple **ladder-like structures (two-by-fours) on trees** because:
        - His eyesight was failing.
        - He staggered when walking and spooked deer.
      - Ladders were a way to **hunt deer more effectively** despite disability.

- **Definitions / key terms**

  - **Watershed**: The land area that drains into a river system; its health affects salmon habitat.
  - **2,4-D**: A widely used herbicide; example of **agricultural/forestry chemical** contaminating rivers.
  - **Conservation laws (state)**: Fishing regulations intended to protect fish stocks, which the state claimed Indians were violating; later shown not to be the true cause of decline.
  - **Frank’s Landing**: Nisqually family/community site on the Nisqually River; central setting for fishing rights struggles.

- **Examples from the text**

  - Environmental impact:
    - Logging + roads + pesticides → **salmon runs “in free fall”**.
  - Misattribution of blame:
    - State officers **blamed Indian fishers** instead of logging, development, and pollution.
  - Life-path details:
    - Billy’s **limited formal education** and **manual labor background** show he was not groomed as a conventional political leader.
    - Joining the **Marines** illustrates both his patriotism and capacity for discipline—traits that later inform his activism.
  - Cultural continuity:
    - Reference to **Leschi’s spirit** indicates how **historical injustice** informs present resistance.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **Cause of salmon decline**:
    - EASY MISTAKE: Blaming “overfishing by Indians” because that’s what state officers claimed.
    - TEXT’S POINT: Decline was mainly from **habitat destruction and pollution**, not Indian fishing.
  - **Conservation vs. discrimination**:
    - State framed their actions as **neutral conservation**, but enforcement was **targeted and punitive** toward Indian treaty fishers.
  - **Billy Frank’s background**:
    - Might assume major activists must have **higher education or formal training**.
    - Here, activism emerges instead from **lived experience, rage at injustice, and cultural legacy**, not credentials.
