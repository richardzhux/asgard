Definitions / ideas
- Frank’s Landing:  
  A small Nisqually Indian community centered around Billy Frank Jr.’s family, which became a focal point of treaty-rights fishing protests.
- “Fish Wars”:  
  Series of confrontations (1960s–70s) between Native fishers and state authorities in Washington State over treaty-guaranteed fishing rights.
- Gillnet inefficiency demonstration (1968):  
  A protest in Olympia’s Budd Inlet, where Native fishers used gillnets in waters visibly full of king salmon but caught none, to show that Indian gillnetting was not the cause of salmon decline; Billy Frank Jr. was jailed despite no fish being taken.
- Treaty-rights encampment (Puyallup, 1970):  
  A fishing camp used to assert treaty rights; raided by a 300-man police force that used tear gas, shotguns, and mass arrests.

Examples from the text
- Family network at Frank’s Landing:
  - Billy Frank Jr. and wife Norma with children Tobin (“Sugar”) and Maureen.
  - Sister Maiselle married to Al Bridges; three daughters Alison, Valerie, Suzette.
  - Another house for nephew Herman; Billy’s father kept a garden; Maiselle grew flowers.
- Economic reality:
  - Salmon provided subsistence and a small income when not confiscated by the state.
  - Family members also worked as farm laborers (Al, Maiselle, daughters) or traveling lineman (Billy) to survive.
- Children as activists:
  - Alison Bridges at age 13 was already a “veteran” of Fish War skirmishes (1965).
  - Maureen photographed proudly holding a salmon days after Billy’s 1968 jail release.
  - Tobin (“Sugar”) first arrested at age nine (1970).
- Violent state enforcement:
  - Frequent raids on Nisqually fishers using gillnets; officers (12–50 at a time) rushed the riverbank.
  - Nisqually fishers often used passive resistance (“dead weight”), being dragged up rocky banks, arms twisted, struck with billy clubs.
  - Tear gas used; people on the banks sometimes threw stones and sticks back.
  - Women like Maiselle and Norma physically clung to nets and were dragged away; Norma was arrested on the river in 1969 despite federal court decisions.
- Puyallup encampment raid (1970):
  - 300 police surrounded the camp, fired tear gas and shotguns indiscriminately, arrested all 62 occupants.
- Civil-rights framing:
  - Author explicitly links Nisqually riverbanks to iconic civil rights sites: Little Rock school steps, Selma bridge, Montgomery buses.
  - Notes emotional complexity: some officers were cold and brutal, others appeared visibly troubled and questioning.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Mistaking Native fishers as the main cause of salmon decline:
  - The Budd Inlet protest was designed to show gillnets’ limited effectiveness, countering the narrative that tribal fishing was depleting runs.
- Assuming enforcement stopped after favorable federal rulings:
  - Text emphasizes that state fisheries agencies “barely fazed” by court decisions and continued raids and arrests.
- Seeing conflicts as purely criminal, not political:
  - The confrontations were deliberate treaty-rights protests akin to sit-ins or freedom rides, not just “poaching” cases.
- Overlooking women’s and children’s roles:
  - Women (Norma, Maiselle) and children (Alison, Tobin, Maureen) were central participants and faced arrest and violence, not merely bystanders.
