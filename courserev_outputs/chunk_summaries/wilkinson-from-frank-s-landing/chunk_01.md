# Chunk 01 (units 1-900)

Key concepts / sections
- Nisqually River & Watershed
- Frank’s Landing (location and community)
- Seasonal cycles of the river
- Salmon runs and life cycles
- Childhood life tied to river and tides

Definitions / ideas
- Nisqually River: River in Washington State; the central natural feature in the narrator’s (Billy Frank Jr.’s) life.
- Tidewater: The part of a river affected by ocean tides; Frank’s Landing is “right near the edge of tidewater,” so river level changes with tides.
- Salmon runs:
  - Spring salmon
  - Summer salmon
  - Fall salmon
  - Winter chum salmon (running up to Muck Creek)
  These recur every year in a predictable cycle.

Key points / examples
- “That river was my life”: The river defines daily experience, identity, and understanding of nature from childhood.
- Seasonal awareness:
  - Winter floods and spring floods
  - Low summer water
  - Knowledge of exactly when the tide comes in and goes out at Frank’s Landing.
- Human–salmon relationship:
  - Children learn to expect salmon returning each season.
  - The salmon life cycle is woven into the rhythm of human life.
- Childhood at Frank’s Landing:
  - Spent summers “in that river” – fishing and swimming every day.
  - Existence of “the Old Road” wooden bridge (removed after WWII):
    - Used for diving.
    - Had a rope swing; kids would swing far out over the river.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Don’t treat the river as just a backdrop: for the narrator it is a living presence shaping time, livelihood, and culture.
- The “cycle” refers both to:
  - Physical river conditions (floods, low water, tides)
  - Biological cycles (seasonal salmon runs), not just one or the other.
- Frank’s Landing is not just a random spot: it’s a specific Indigenous community site strongly tied to treaty fishing rights (expanded later in the text).
