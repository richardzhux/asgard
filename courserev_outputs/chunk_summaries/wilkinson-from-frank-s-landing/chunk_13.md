# Chunk 13 (units 9841-10740)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Complexity of enforcing the Boldt Decision**
    - Ruling covered:
      - 21 tribes
      - Hundreds of tribal fishers
      - Thousands of non-Indian commercial fishers
      - Hundreds of thousands of sport fishers
      - Dozens of rivers, multiple runs per year
    - Environmental and biological conditions (run sizes, locations, timing) constantly changing.

  - **Run size and allocation problem (hypothetical 1977 Puyallup fall chinook)**
    - Example question: How many chinook are headed from the Gulf of Alaska to the Puyallup in 1977? 8,000? 2,000? 20,000?
    - Fish for one river’s run are mixed in the ocean with fish destined for many other rivers.
    - Key legal issue: How many fish can offshore trollers (non-Indians) take so that river-based tribal fishers can still get their 50% share?

  - **Scientific management and the Court Advisor**
    - Judge Boldt appoints a Court Advisor (initially UW biologist Richard Whitney).
    - Process:
      - One representative from state + one from tribes submit info.
      - Advisor makes a recommendation to the court.
      - Boldt almost always upholds the Advisor’s recommendation.
    - Purpose: reduce contested hearings and bring scientific expertise into allocation decisions.
    - Challenge: decisions often had to be made on incomplete or uncertain data; repeated for many runs, rivers, and years.

  - **Legal status vs. political resistance**
    - Boldt decision:
      - Affirmed by 9th Circuit (1975).
      - Supreme Court denied review (1976).
      - Therefore final and considered “supreme law of the land,” overriding conflicting state law.
    - Despite this, Washington state officials and non-Indian commercial/sport fishers persistently resisted.

  - **State noncompliance and non-Indian defiance**
    - Judge Boldt issues numerous non-treaty fishery closures; a toll-free “hotline” created to track changes.
    - WA Department of Fisheries frequently:
      - Refused to enforce closure orders.
      - When it did enforce, state courts often dismissed charges (state judges acting in effect as allies of state administrators).
    - Non-Indians organized:
      - “Fish-ins” in defiance of closures.
      - Protest rallies, ballot initiatives, and court challenges against Indian treaty rights.

  - **Volume of post-trial litigation**
    - Hundreds of contested enforcement orders issued by Boldt.
    - West Publishing released a special “Compilation of Major Post-Trial Orders” (37 orders), collectively longer than the original Boldt opinion.

  - **Vigilantism and anti-Boldt sentiment**
    - “Outlaw fisheries” (illegal non-Indian fishing) became common.
    - Public backlash included:
      - Effigies of Judge Boldt being hung.
      - Bumper stickers like:
        - “Slice Belloni, Screw Boldt”
        - “Can Judge Boldt, Not Salmon”
        - “Let’s Give 50 Percent of the Indians to Judge Boldt”
    - As summarized by Fay Cohen, organized non-Indian groups attacked Indian treaty rights on the water, in courts, through politics, and through public protests.
    - Massive illegal fishing continued for years after the 1974 decision.

- **Definitions / key terms**

  - **Boldt Decision (United States v. Washington, 1974)**: Federal court decision holding that treaty tribes in Washington are entitled to up to 50% of harvestable fish at their usual and accustomed fishing places.
  - **Court Advisor**: Neutral scientific expert appointed by Judge Boldt to evaluate biological data and recommend technical findings (e.g., run size, needed closures).
  - **Non-treaty fishing**: Fishing by those without treaty rights (typically non-Indians) that must be managed so it does not infringe on treaty-protected tribal shares.

- **Examples**

  - Hypothetical 1977 Puyallup River fall chinook run used to show:
    - Uncertainty in estimating total run size.
    - Difficulty of making offshore allocation decisions to preserve in-river tribal share.
  - “Fish-ins” by non-Indians mirrored earlier tribal tactics, but now used to defy treaty enforcement.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **“Final” vs. “followed”**:
    - Even though the Boldt decision was legally final and supreme over state law, the state’s refusal to enforce it and ongoing non-Indian resistance meant it was not smoothly implemented.
  - **Role of science**:
    - Scientific estimates are not precise facts; they involve uncertainty and incomplete data, which complicates legal allocation (students may overestimate precision).
  - **State vs. federal authority**:
    - State agencies and courts did not automatically fall in line after federal rulings; enforcement of federal treaty rights required ongoing federal judicial pressure.
  - **Non-Indian fish-ins**:
    - Can be confused with earlier Indian fish-ins; here they are protests against treaty rights, not for them.
