Definitions / core ideas
- United States v. Washington:
  - Major federal case over treaty fishing rights in Washington.
  - U.S. sues on behalf of tribes (as trustee) against the state.
- Trustee role of the U.S.:
  - Federal government litigates to protect tribal treaty rights.
- “In common with the citizens of the Territory”:
  - Critical Stevens treaty phrase about fishing rights.
  - Tribal lawyers argued “common” = “equal,” supporting up to a 50/50 fish allocation.
- Treaty interpretation rule:
  - Treaty language must be read as the tribes’ negotiators would have understood it.
  - Ambiguities resolved in favor of tribes.
- “Actual-needs standard”:
  - Tribal argument that treaties reserved “sufficient fish to meet their needs,”
    not limited to a fixed percentage like 50%.
- “Fair share”:
  - Earlier standard from Judge Belloni’s Sohappy decision (Columbia River).
  - U.S. initially wanted only reaffirmation of “fair share,” then shifted to seek a clearer and higher allocation.

People and roles
- Tribal-side lawyers:
  - David Getches (NARF) – lead counsel for many tribes.
  - John Sennhauser, Michael Taylor, David Allen – Seattle/Evergreen Legal Services, co‑counsel.
  - Alvin Ziontz – prominent Seattle lawyer, represented Makah, Lummi, Quileute.
  - Alan Stay – later represented Nisqually.
- Judge George H. Boldt:
  - Tough, law‑and‑order federal judge; no background in Indian law.
  - Known for strict decorum and serious sentencing (e.g., Teamster Dave Beck, boxing figure Frankie Carbo).
  - Declared mistrial for the “Seattle Seven” but held them in contempt.
  - United States v. Washington became the most significant case of his federal career.

Examples from treaty negotiations / evidence
- Barbara Lane’s anthropological report:
  - Showed Governor Isaac Stevens reassured tribes that their fishing would not be restricted.
  - Example: At Point No Point, Stevens told tribes, “This paper secures your fish.”
  - Supports tribal view: non-Indians could share the fish but not interfere with traditional tribal practices.

Key precedents
- United States v. Winans (1905):
  - Upheld Yakama off-reservation fishing rights on land later homesteaded by non‑Indians.
  - Established that doubtful treaty language is interpreted as Indians would have understood it.
  - Emphasized importance of fishing: right to fish “not much less necessary to the existence of the Indians than the atmosphere they breathed.”
  - Supports strong protection and potentially generous allocation of fish to tribes.
- Tulee v. Washington (1942):
  - Held that Washington State could not require off-reservation treaty Indians to buy state fishing licenses.
  - Reinforced that state regulatory power is limited where it burdens treaty fishing rights.

Strategic issues / debates
- State’s position:
  - Argued tribes had no special treaty rights distinct from other citizens.
- Tribal attorneys’ position:
  - Opposed state regulatory authority over treaty fishing.
  - Favored broad tribal authority and strong protection of treaty rights.
  - Avoided explicitly demanding a fixed percentage, fearing the judge might pick a lower figure.
  - Floated the 50% idea cautiously:
    - Used 1828 and 1862 dictionary definitions of “common” = “equal” to justify that even non‑Indian negotiators couldn’t have intended tribes give up more than half their fishing rights.
- U.S. attorneys’ evolution:
  - Initially satisfied with reaffirming Belloni’s “fair share” standard.
  - After appointing special trial counsel Stuart Pierson, shifted to:
    - Treat “fair share” as a stepping stone.
    - Ask Judge Boldt for a more precise and higher allocation standard (potentially 50%).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusion: “In common with” means tribes waived special rights.
  - Clarification: Tribal and later federal argument is that “common” = “equal,” not “identical,” preserving a strong tribal share.
- Confusion: 50% was clearly demanded by tribes from the start.
  - Clarification: Tribal lawyers were cautious—introduced the idea indirectly but did not press it as a hard number.
- Confusion: “Fair share” is already a precise allocation.
  - Clarification: “Fair share” is vague; the case sought a more specific, enforceable measure.
- Confusion: State can regulate treaty fisheries as it does all citizens.
  - Clarification: Cases like Winans and Tulee limit state authority where it conflicts with treaty rights.
