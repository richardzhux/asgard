Definitions / core ideas
- **Boldt Decision (1974)**  
  - Federal court ruling that:
    - Reaffirmed treaty fishing rights.  
    - Allocated up to **50% of harvestable fish** to treaty tribes.  
    - Recognized **tribal sovereignty**: tribes had authority and responsibility to regulate their own members and manage fisheries.
- **Tribal sovereignty (in this context)**  
  - Legal recognition that tribes are self-governing entities with power to make their own fishing regulations and management systems, subject to doing it responsibly and under state scrutiny.

Key narrative points / examples
- **Judge Boldt’s stance and sacrifice**
  - Seen as open-minded and firm: once his mind was made up, he “never wavered.”
  - He listened to Native witnesses and let them tell their stories in federal court.
  - Social backlash: ostracized from clubs and social circles; faced ridicule (“Can Judge Boldt” bumper stickers).
  - Gave tribes not only rights to fish but a **“tool to help save the salmon”** and to create their own management systems.
  - Billy emphasizes a **lasting responsibility** to honor and uphold what Boldt did.

- **Billy Frank Jr.’s early drinking and fatigue**
  - Never drank in the Marine Corps; drinking escalated in the 1970s.
  - Contributing factors:
    - Physical and emotional toll of repeated arrests, jail time, and treaty-rights marches.
    - Culture of heavy drinking among linemen on the road.
    - Sense that there was “a lot to celebrate” and excitement among Indian leaders after gains.
  - Realization moment: hangover kept him from work; he recognized alcohol interfered with what he “had to do” and how he performed.

- **Valerie Bridges’ role and influence**
  - Daughter of Maiselle Bridges, Billy’s niece, key unifying figure at Frank’s Landing.
  - Described as valiant, tough, direct, articulate; deeply involved in the cause.
  - Urged Billy to quit drinking: “Uncle, you can change the world if you would just stop.”
  - Died by drowning at Frank’s Landing in 1970 (likely accident, no foul play indicated).
  - Her words continued to influence Billy through Maiselle Bridges and Hank Adams.

- **Responsibility after Boldt**
  - Boldt’s decision did more than assign fish shares; it:
    - Affirmed tribal self-governance.
    - Imposed a duty on tribes to **regulate their own members correctly**.
  - Indian leaders knew the state would scrutinize their management, adding pressure to act responsibly.

- **Billy’s recovery and later life**
  - Enrolled in intensive recovery at Shickshadel Institute (near Sea‑Tac) in 1974, shortly after the Boldt decision.
  - Has not drunk since then; Boldt decision marked a personal turning point.
  - Suffered further tragedy in 1977 (loss of daughter Maureen and granddaughter Cabaqhud in a car accident).  
    - Hank Adams feared relapse, but Billy stayed sober.
  - Met lawyer **Sue Crystal** (Ralph Johnson’s protégée, aide to Senator Magnuson) during land acquisition for Wa He Lut Indian School.
  - Billy and first wife Norma separated but remained close until her death in 1987.
  - Billy retained leadership (chair of the Northwest Indian … [tribal fish commission implied]).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- **Misunderstanding Boldt as only about fish allocation**  
  - The decision is often reduced to “50% of the fish,” but equally important was:
    - Legal recognition of **tribal sovereignty** in fisheries.
    - The obligation for tribes to self-regulate effectively.
- **Assuming activism ended with Boldt**  
  - For Billy, Boldt was a turning point but not an endpoint. It triggered:
    - A new phase of responsibility in co-management.
    - Personal transformation (sobriety), not a reduction in activism.
- **Overlooking personal costs**  
  - Public tends to see court victories, not:
    - Social ostracism of allies like Boldt.
    - Personal losses and stress experienced by Native leaders.
- **Equating Native leadership with dysfunction**  
  - Story shows a shift: earlier prevalence of drinking among leaders vs. later expectation of sobriety and disciplined leadership.
