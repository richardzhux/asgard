# Chunk 14 (units 10661-11560)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Non-Indian resistance to the Boldt Decision (U.S. v. Washington)**
    - Organized non-Indian groups attacked treaty-based Indian fishing rights after the 1974 Boldt decision.
    - Resistance took multiple forms:
      - Defiance “on the waters” (continuing to fish illegally).
      - Challenges in **state courts**.
      - **Ballot initiatives**.
      - **Protest rallies** and vigilantism.

  - **Scale of illegal fishing / enforcement problems**
    - 1976: Even with a court-ordered closure, patrol officers observed:
      - ~247 fishermen fishing illegally.
    - 1977 (Bellingham Bay and northern Hood Canal, evidence later in court):
      - 7,036 illegally caught chinook (≈109,204 pounds).
      - 33,359 illegally caught chum (≈337,623 pounds).
    - Shows how extensive non-compliance was despite federal rulings.

  - **Supreme Court comparison to Deep South desegregation**
    - 1979: Supreme Court reviewed a related case challenging Boldt.
    - The Court reaffirmed nearly all aspects of Boldt.
    - Quoting the court of appeals, the Supreme Court compared:
      - Washington’s resistance to treaty fishing rights
      - To the **Deep South’s resistance to desegregation**.
    - Noted:
      - The district court had to “take over a large share” of fishery management to enforce its decrees.
      - Resistance was among “the most concerted official and private efforts to frustrate a decree of a federal court” in the 20th century, outside some desegregation cases.

  - **Judge George Boldt’s judicial approach**
    - Background:
      - Conservative, Eisenhower appointee, tough “no-nonsense” judge.
      - No prior expertise in Indian law.
      - Tribal lawyers initially feared he would not grasp tribal history or treaty law.
    - Method:
      - He educated himself: spent “days and days” reading major decisions on Indians and fishing rights.
      - Observed that courts historically recognized:
        - The U.S. had taken away Indians’ “rightful heritage.”
        - Tribes would not sign treaties without retaining rights to fish at their “usual and accustomed places.”
      - Similar methodical approach likened to Judge Frank Johnson in Alabama desegregation cases.

  - **The 50–50 allocation and Boldt’s judgment**
    - Boldt acknowledged the 50–50 split was not mathematically dictated by the treaties.
    - It required **judicial judgment**:
      - He noted another judge might have ruled for 1/3 or 1/4 to the tribes instead.
    - Emphasis from scholars:
      - Prof. Ralph Johnson: Boldt educated himself over a long preparation, found what he believed to be the truth, and “applied simple justice.”
      - Prof. William Rodgers: Boldt was open-minded before deciding; once decided, he “was a giant” and did not waver.

  - **Personal and symbolic conflict around Boldt**
    - U.S. Marshals had to:
      - Remove hanged effigies of Judge Boldt from federal courthouse grounds (symbolic threats/vigilantism).
      - Intervene against non-Indian harvesters poaching the tribes’ salmon shares.
    - Boldt later visited Indian reservations and tribal fisheries:
      - To see the impact of his decrees firsthand.
    - Billy Frank Jr.’s perspective:
      - Boldt “listened to all of us” and let them tell their stories in federal court.
      - He “interpreted the treaty” and gave tribes “a tool to help save the salmon.”
      - Frank notes Boldt “went through a lot,” indicating personal and political pressures.

- **Definitions / key terms**

  - **Boldt Decision (1974)**: Federal district court ruling in U.S. v. Washington that:
    - Affirmed treaty tribes’ rights to fish at usual and accustomed grounds.
    - Interpreted those rights to entitle tribes to up to 50% of the harvestable fish.
  - **Usual and accustomed places**: Treaty term referring to the traditional fishing locations where tribes had long taken fish and reserved the right to continue doing so.
  - **Vigilantism**: Private citizens taking law enforcement into their own hands; here, used to describe non-Indian actions, intimidation, and illegal fishing against the backdrop of a federal court decree.

- **Examples**

  - **Illegal catch data as concrete evidence of resistance**
    - 7,036 illegally caught chinook (109,204 pounds) in Bellingham Bay (~1977).
    - 33,359 illegally caught chum (337,623 pounds) in northern Hood Canal (~1977).
    - These numbers served as evidence in later court proceedings to show massive non-compliance.

  - **Judicial comparison**
    - Supreme Court’s analogy:
      - Washington treaty fishing enforcement ≈ federal desegregation enforcement in the Deep South, in terms of resistance and the need for aggressive court oversight.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **Assuming the Boldt Decision was quickly accepted**
    - In reality, there were years of state resistance, massive illegal fishing, and political backlash.
    - Enforcement required unusual federal court management of a state resource.

  - **Thinking 50–50 was explicitly written into treaties**
    - The treaties do not specify “50 percent”; Boldt derived that figure as a fair interpretation of reserved rights, balancing tribal and non-tribal interests.
    - He admits another judge might have chosen a different proportion.

  - **Viewing Boldt as ideologically pro-Indian from the start**
    - He began with no Indian law background and a conservative reputation.
    - His ruling followed extensive self-education and application of existing Indian law precedents, not a pre-existing policy agenda.

  - **Overlooking the civil-rights dimension**
    - The case is not just about fish; it’s about enforcement of minority rights against entrenched local opposition.
    - The Supreme Court’s comparison to desegregation underscores this broader civil rights and federalism context.
