# Chunk 06 (units 4101-5000)

Key concepts / sections
- Continued state resistance and arrests
  - State fisheries agencies largely ignored early federal court decisions favoring Native treaty rights.
  - Indian fishermen continued to challenge state enforcement; arrests were common (e.g., Norma Frank dragged from her boat on the Nisqually in 1969).
  - 1970 Puyallup encampment arrests drew national media attention and helped lead to the filing of United States v. Washington.

- Faith in federal courts and the treaties
  - People at Frank’s Landing distrusted Washington state courts but believed the federal judiciary would uphold treaties as the “supreme law of the land.”
  - They drew on earlier success: in 1937, Billy Frank’s father and other Nisqually fishermen had obtained a federal injunction against state interference.

- Frank’s Landing as a political and cultural focus
  - Became recognized in the 1960s as a symbolic site of resistance and a place to honor treaty rights and Chief Leschi’s legacy.
  - Attracted national figures and allies:  
    - Marlon Brando (actor)  
    - Buffy Sainte-Marie (Canadian Native folk singer)  
    - Richard White (future historian)  
    - Elizabeth Furse (future Oregon congresswoman)  
    - Dick Gregory (Black comedian and civil rights figure)
  - Dick Gregory’s quip at a press conference—refusing “tribal membership” because he already had “enough problems”—illustrates use of humor in solidarity.

- Economic dimension: salmon and anti-poverty efforts
  - Historical continuity:
    - Treaty era (Medicine Creek Treaty) recognized commercial fishing; tribes traded salmon with inland tribes and later sold to white farmers.
  - Modern strategy:
    - Salmon sales were a way to fight poverty as well as assert rights.
    - Local buyers paid ~10¢/lb; distant markets (e.g., San Francisco, New York) paid ~$1/lb.
    - Example: loading freshly cleaned Nisqually silver salmon into a plain white truck at night, bound for Union Square in San Francisco; volunteers also sold in Golden Gate Park.
    - Community framed this work spiritually and politically (“You’re doing the Great Spirit’s work!”).

- Geography and land at Frank’s Landing
  - Physical features:
    - Within tidal reach; sloping banks and gravel bars—ideal for launching and mooring boats.
    - Location of the lower Nisqually’s last fixed-cable ferry.
  - Land status:
    - Willie Frank’s 1884 allotment was farthest upriver; Frank’s Landing was the Indian land farthest downstream on the reservation.

- Daily life and atmosphere at Frank’s Landing
  - Described as “kaleidoscopic” and “organized chaos”:
    - Family life mixed with:
      - Armed arrests and fierce resistance
      - Visiting Indian people from many places
      - Celebrities, Black Panthers, SDS members, hippies, and other supporters
      - Continuous surveillance from across the river
    - Activities:
      - Smoke from smokehouses and wood stoves
      - Commerce and fish processing at long-used butchering tables
      - Serious discussions of treaties, federal courts, the Constitution
      - Persistent Indian humor and laughter despite danger
  - Generational anchors:
    - Billy Frank Sr. (Billy’s dad) stopped fishing in his 80s but remained a moral anchor, walking among the maple and cottonwood trees, tapping them with his cane.
    - Billy Frank Jr. also served as an anchor, though more involved “down on the…” river (text cuts off).

Definitions / key terms
- Treaty rights: Legal rights guaranteed to tribes in treaties (e.g., to fish at “usual and accustomed” places); understood by the community as part of the “supreme law of the land” (U.S. Constitution, Article VI).
- United States v. Washington: Landmark federal case (initiated after events like the Puyallup arrests) that would later clarify and affirm tribal treaty fishing rights (Boldt Decision).

Examples
- Arrest example: Norma Frank arrested on the Nisqually River (1969).
- Media image: Photograph of Alison Bridges Gottfriedson at the 1970 Puyallup encampment widely circulated, boosting national awareness.
- Commerce example: Michael Hunt and Joe Carson cleaning silver salmon for shipment to New York and volunteer sellers in California.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Thinking the struggle was only about “cultural” rights:
  - The text emphasizes both legal-political (treaties, federal courts) and economic (escaping poverty through salmon sales) dimensions.
- Assuming tribes relied only on local support:
  - In fact, they actively cultivated national allies, media attention, and cross-movement solidarity (civil rights activists, celebrities, student radicals).
- Misunderstanding court venues:
  - The Nisqually and allies distrusted state courts but strategically sought relief in federal courts, which they believed were bound more firmly to uphold treaties.
