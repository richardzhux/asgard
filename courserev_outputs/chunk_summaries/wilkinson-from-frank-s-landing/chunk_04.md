# Chunk 04 (units 2461-3360)

Key concepts / sections
- Ongoing harassment and violence against Nisqually fishers
- Frank’s Landing as a center of treaty-rights activism
- Federal “termination” policy toward tribes (1950s–60s)
- Daily life at Frank’s Landing between fish runs

Definitions / key ideas
- Treaty rights (implied here):  
  The legally binding rights reserved by tribes in treaties (e.g., rights to fish in usual and accustomed places), which states were actively trying to suppress or ignore.
- Termination policy:  
  Official U.S. policy in the 1950s to:
  - End the special legal/political status of tribes  
  - Sell off reservations  
  - End federal education and health programs  
  - Place Indians fully under state laws  
  - Force assimilation into mainstream society  
  Described as as dangerous and focused as earlier attacks on land and culture in Leschi’s era.
- Tribal sovereignty movement:  
  Post-termination-era movement in which tribes reasserted their status as sovereign nations, including control over their own laws, resources, and political future.
- Frank’s Landing:
  - Physical: Nisqually River riverside compound with several family houses and gardens.
  - Political/moral: Focal point of Northwest tribal treaty-rights struggles and a moral center of the national tribal sovereignty movement.

Examples from the text
- Violent state enforcement on the river:
  - Game wardens ram Billy Frank’s canoe (with Al Bridges aboard), capsizing it at full speed.  
  - Billy and Bridges struggle to swim in hip boots, fear drowning.  
  - Arrested, taken by boat to Tacoma, released around midnight; fined; salmon, nets, and Johnny Bobb’s cedar canoe confiscated.
  - Wardens equipped with riot gear (shields, helmets) and fancy new boats, reflecting federal funding and a “war” mentality.
- Learning the river vs. state intruders:
  - Billy notes that wardens initially didn’t know how to run boats on the river.  
  - Nisqually fishers recognized wardens’ hiding places by absence of ducks.
- Everyday risk:
  - Harassment “nearly a daily event”; a “good day” was one without arrest.  
  - Standing family practice: if they didn’t return home, relatives called bail bondsman C.J. Johnson.
- Broader civil-rights context:
  - Time of Selma and national unrest; law-enforcement buildup linked to federal programs responding to that context.
- Daily life and family at Frank’s Landing:
  - Four modest houses among maples, fir, cedar, dogwood on the west bank.
  - Residents: Billy’s parents; sister Maiselle and husband Al Bridges with their three daughters; Billy and wife Norma with children Tobin (“Sugar”) and Maureen; nephew Herman.
  - Billy’s dad’s garden (corn, rhubarb, squash); Maiselle’s flowers.
  - Families “patch together a living” between seasonal salmon runs.
- Other activists:
  - Demonstrations also led by Bob Satiacum, Ramona Bennett, and others on the Puyallup River in Tacoma.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- It might seem like Frank’s Landing was constantly in crisis; text clarifies that intense conflict flared mainly during salmon runs. Between runs, life there was relatively peaceful and family-centered.
- Harassment is not random “game enforcement” but part of a larger political project:
  - Linked to federal termination policy and state efforts to override treaty rights.
  - Militarized tactics (riot gear, high-speed boats) show it functioned like a low-level war against Native fishers, not routine regulation.
