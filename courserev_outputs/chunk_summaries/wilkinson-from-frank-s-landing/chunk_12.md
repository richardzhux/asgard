# Chunk 12 (units 9021-9920)

**Key concepts / sections**

- **Allies and legal groundwork before Boldt**
  - Ralph Johnson (UW law professor) worked on appeals of state injunctions against Billy Frank Jr.; sympathetic to tribal treaty rights.
  - Hank Adams befriended Cathy Douglas (wife of Justice William O. Douglas); she visited Frank’s Landing and came to support tribal claims.
  - Suggestion that such personal relationships may have indirectly influenced Supreme Court attitudes in the *Puyallup* cases.

- **State agencies’ split positions**
  - **WA Dept. of Fisheries**
    - Jurisdiction: all salmonids except steelhead.
    - Pre‑Boldt position: “fair share” = ⅓ to tribes, ⅓ to non‑Indian sport fishers, ⅓ to non‑Indian commercial fishers.
    - Indicates growing recognition of the strength and morality of tribal claims.
  - **WA Dept. of Game**
    - Jurisdiction: steelhead.
    - Hardline stance: denied any “special” treaty rights; consistently opposed to recognizing treaty-based priority.

- **The Boldt Trial (1973)**
  - Location: Federal courthouse, Tacoma.
  - Duration: About one month (fall 1973).
  - Expert witnesses for U.S. and tribes:
    - Dr. Barbara Lane (anthropologist / historian of tribes).
    - Jim Heckman (biologist).
  - Tribal presence:
    - Many tribal members in the gallery; several testified.
    - Billy Frank Jr. testified about repeated arrests and gear seizures.
    - Elders such as:
      - Lena Hillaire (Puyallup, age 86).
      - Billy’s father (age 95).
    - Elders recounted handed‑down history and treaty understandings.
  - Judge Boldt was notably attentive, especially to elders’ testimony.

- **The Boldt Decision (1974)**
  - Date: February 12, 1974.
  - Scope:
    - One of the most sweeping judicial rulings in Pacific Northwest history.
    - Ruled for the tribes on nearly all counts.
    - Key allocation rule: **50–50 division** of harvestable salmon and steelhead between treaty tribes and non‑Indians.
  - Length and character:
    - 203‑page opinion.
    - “Rich with history,” consistent with the Supreme Court’s instruction in *Winans* that treaties must be interpreted as Indians would have understood them.
  - Intellectual basis:
    - Attributed largely to Boldt’s own “sense of history, law, and fairness,” and his courage.
    - Tribal and federal lawyers argued for a large tribal share and tentatively suggested an equal split, but the final 50–50 rule was Boldt’s choice.

- **Historical / moral justification from tribal viewpoint**
  - For “thousands of years” before treaties, tribes:
    - Built their lives around salmon; no limits on their catch.
  - At treaty time:
    - Tribes insisted on protecting their right to fish.
    - Gov. Stevens assured them this right would continue.
  - Thus, a 50–50 share is portrayed as **logical, just, even conservative** from a tribal perspective.

- **Non‑Indian reaction / perspective**
  - Indians were < 1% of the population at the time.
  - Due to strict state regulation, they were only taking ~5% of the total salmon harvest when the trial began.
  - To non‑Indian fishers, 50–50 seemed:
    - “Radical,” even a “travesty.”
  - Shows the clash between:
    - Treaty‑based rights vs. majoritarian expectations based on population and then‑current catch shares.

- **Implementation and enforcement difficulties**
  - Boldt’s order applied to:
    - 21 tribes.
    - Several hundred tribal fishers.
    - Thousands of non‑Indian commercial fishers.
    - Hundreds of thousands of sport fishers.
    - Dozens of rivers, each with multiple annual fish runs.
  - Physical and biological complexity:
    - Fish runs vary by year, species, river, and season.
    - Example introduced (hypothetical): a fall chinook run on the Puyallup River in 1977 with a harvestable run of ~8,000 fish.
  - Result: enforcing a precise 50–50 division was extraordinarily complex compared to a typical court decree.

**Definitions / key ideas**

- **Treaty fishing rights**: Rights reserved by tribes in 19th‑century treaties to continue fishing at their “usual and accustomed places.” These rights are property‑like and must be interpreted as tribes understood them at signing.
- **“Fair share”** (pre‑Boldt Fisheries definition): A proposed allocation of **⅓ tribes / ⅓ sport / ⅓ commercial** (non‑Indian).
- **Boldt 50–50 rule**: A judicially imposed rule that **50% of the harvestable fish** (salmon and steelhead) passing through a tribe’s usual and accustomed grounds are reserved for treaty tribes.
- **Winans (Supreme Court case)**: Earlier precedent stating that Indian treaties must be construed as the Indians themselves would have understood them.

**Examples present in the text**

- **Hypothetical run**: Fall chinook on the Puyallup River in 1977 with a harvestable run of 8,000 fish is raised as an example scenario to illustrate how the 50–50 rule would need to be applied in practice.
- **Elders’ testimony**: Personal histories (Billy’s multiple arrests, elders’ recounting of treaty assurances) function as illustrative evidence of how tribes understood the treaties and experienced state regulation.

**Pitfalls / common confusions**

- **“Special rights” vs. treaty rights**
  - Misconception: Tribes are given “special” privileges.
  - Clarification: Treaty rights are not new gifts
