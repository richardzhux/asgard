# Chunk 11 (units 8201-9100)

Key concepts / sections
- Strategic shift in United States v. Washington
- Washington State’s “no special rights” stance
- State v. Towessnute (1916) and anti-tribal judicial rhetoric
- Puyallup I (1968): conservation rationale
- Ralph Johnson’s critique (1972)
- Puyallup II (1973): conservation vs. allocation and net fishing

Definitions / doctrines
- “Fair share” (Sohappy/Belloni):
  - Earlier federal court notion: tribes entitled to a “fair share” of the fish, but not numerically fixed.
  - Seen later as only a “stepping stone” toward a clearer and higher allocation standard.
- 50-50 allocation:
  - Proposed formula that tribes and U.S. lawyers considered asking Judge Boldt to adopt.
  - Would allocate 50% of harvestable fish to tribes and 50% to non-Indians.
- “Necessary for conservation”:
  - Legal standard (from Puyallup I) allowing states to regulate off-reservation tribal fishing when regulations are:
    - Reasonable and necessary to conserve the species, and
    - Nondiscriminatory.
- Allocation vs. conservation:
  - Conservation: rules truly aimed at preserving the resource.
  - Allocation: rules that divide harvest among user groups without genuine conservation necessity.

Content summary / examples
- Litigation strategy in U.S. v. Washington:
  - Federal and tribal lawyers first: “fair share” is enough.
  - After hiring Stuart Pierson (special trial counsel) they seek a more precise and generous standard.
  - Joint Post-Trial Brief:
    - Says treaty right is not capped at 50%.
    - Argues tribes are guaranteed enough fish to meet tribal needs, not a fixed quota.
  - Final oral argument split:
    - Pierson (U.S.): recommends a 50-50 allocation.
    - Ziontz & Getches (tribes): argue against any numeric quota; emphasize “as many fish as necessary to meet tribal needs.”

- Washington State’s stance:
  - Argues treaty Indians are like any other citizens, fully subject to state fishing laws—no special treaty rights.
  - Cites state sovereignty and “equal rights” rhetoric (e.g., Jack Metcalf rejecting “hereditary aristocracy” of rights).
  - Department of Game head: sees the issue as pure law enforcement; insists on using “full force” to arrest resisters.

- State v. Towessnute (1916):
  - WA Supreme Court rejects “Indian sovereignty.”
  - Describes Indians in overtly racist, paternalistic terms as “dangerous child of nature.”
  - Used in the 1960s–70s as ideological support for aggressive enforcement against tribal fishers.

- Puyallup I (1968, Justice Douglas):
  - Holds the state may regulate off-reservation tribal fishing if:
    - Regulations are “reasonable and necessary” for conservation.
  - This seemed to support state claims that they were only regulating for conservation.

- Ralph Johnson’s 1972 article:
  - Argues Washington’s system is not about conserving salmon but allocating fish among user groups.
  - Asserts that allocation to tribes was already made in the treaties, which are supreme over state law.

- Puyallup II (1973, Justice Douglas):
  - Question: Can WA ban all net fishing for steelhead?
  - Douglas (following Johnson’s reasoning) finds:
    - The net ban is not “necessary for conservation.”
    - It is in fact an allocation scheme favoring hook-and-line sport fishers over Indian net fishers.
    - Since Indians historically used nets, the state cannot prohibit Indian net fishing in these circumstances.
  - Effect: Rejects the state’s broad conservation justification and undercuts discriminatory “allocation disguised as conservation.”

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing “fair share” with a precise number:
  - “Fair share” in Sohappy was vague; tribes later pursued a clearer, possibly 50% standard or a “needs-based” standard.
- Assuming all plaintiffs agreed on 50-50:
  - Federal counsel ultimately argued for 50-50.
  - Tribal counsel resisted a fixed numerical quota and argued for a needs-based measure.
- Treating Puyallup I as fully endorsing state power:
  - It allowed some regulation for conservation, but Puyallup II narrowed this by exposing abuses where “conservation” was really allocation.
- Misreading “equal rights” rhetoric:
  - The state’s claim that “everyone is equal under the law” ignores treaty-based rights under the Supremacy Clause, which can and do create special protections for tribes.
