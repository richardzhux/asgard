Definitions / key ideas
- Frank’s Landing:  
  - A Nisqually community on the Nisqually River.  
  - Historically a principal Nisqually buying station for tribal fishermen and canneries.  
  - Became a central site (“ground zero”) for the treaty fishing-rights struggle.
- Treaty rights (implied):  
  - Rights guaranteed in treaties between Native nations and the U.S. government (including fishing rights).  
  - Described as “the supreme law of the land under their Constitution.”
- National Indian Youth Council (NIYC):  
  - A national Native youth organization focused on Indian rights and activism.  
  - Hank Adams joined as an organizer; it was a vehicle for new, more militant Native leadership.

Key people and their roles
- Billy Frank Jr.  
  - Nisqually fisherman and central activist; “not a policy guy… a getting-arrested guy.”  
  - Lived on the river and actively defended treaty fishing rights through civil disobedience (fish-ins, arrests).  
  - Became a symbolic figure through media coverage (“we aren’t going anywhere”) and an anchor of the movement.
- Billy’s father  
  - Elder fisherman who stopped fishing in his 80s but remained a moral anchor at Frank’s Landing, encouraging people and symbolically “checking in” on the old trees.
- Maiselle Bridges (Billy’s sister)  
  - Major strategist; focused on spreading the Frank’s Landing story and organizing the treaty-rights campaign.  
  - Represented the more “policy/strategy” side compared to Billy’s direct action.
- Maiselle’s daughters (Alison, Suzette, Valerie)  
  - Alison & Suzette: handled organizational and logistical tasks.  
  - Valerie: powerful public speaker, explicitly framing the struggle in constitutional and treaty language (“We have this treaty right, the supreme law of the land…”).
- Hank Adams  
  - Assiniboine and Sioux from Fort Peck (Montana), great-grandson of Chief Yellow Eagle.  
  - Extremely dedicated, “tireless, fiery,” and meticulous strategist; deeply versed in Indian history and law, especially 1950s–60s assimilation policies.  
  - Left the University of Washington after two years to pursue activism.  
  - Joined NIYC, came to Frank’s Landing in 1964 as an organizer.  
  - Central planner of the treaty-rights strategy; combined “grand scheme” thinking with precise attention to legal and organizing details.  
  - Organized a large 1964 demonstration (~2,000 supporters) at the Washington state capitol.  
  - Intended his stay to be temporary but in reality remained committed to Frank’s Landing for life.

Examples / illustrations
- Direct action:  
  - Billy Frank Jr. repeatedly getting arrested for exercising fishing rights; his image and words circulated widely via newsreels and newspapers.
- Public framing of rights:  
  - Valerie’s quote: “We set the net and waited for the state. We have to let them know we’re not going to stop fishing. We have this treaty right, the supreme law of the land under their Constitution.”  
  - Shows intentional use of U.S. constitutional language to legitimize Native claims to a broader audience.
- Mass demonstration:  
  - Hank Adams organized a rally at the state capitol, drawing about 2,000 supporters, signaling the movement’s growing visibility and support.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Billy Frank Jr. vs. Hank Adams:
  - Billy: Nisqually, local fisherman, focus on direct action and symbolic resistance.  
  - Hank: Assiniboine/Sioux, national organizer/strategist, legal and political planner.
- Strategy vs. tactics:
  - Billy self-described as “not a policy guy,” more about on-the-ground confrontation (arrests).  
  - Maiselle Bridges and Hank Adams handled overarching strategy, messaging, and legal/political planning.
- Local vs. national:
  - Frank’s Landing is a specific Nisqually site, but the struggle there becomes symbolic of broader Native treaty rights nationwide through organizers like Adams and groups like NIYC.
