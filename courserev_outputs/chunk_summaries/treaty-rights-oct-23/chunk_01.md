**Treaty Rights – Compact Study Notes**

---

### Key Concepts / Sections

- **“Domestic dependent nations”**
  - Legal status of Native tribes: sovereign governments, but in a dependent relationship with the U.S. (not fully independent foreign nations; not just interest groups).

---

### Reserved Rights Doctrine

- **Definition**
  - Treaties are not a grant of rights *to* tribes, but a grant of rights *from* them; tribes keep (“reserve”) all rights not explicitly given up.
  - Case: **U.S. v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371 (1905)**.

- **Implication**
  - If a treaty is silent on a right, presume the tribe still has it.
  - Non‑Native landowners get title burdened by tribal reserved rights (e.g., fishing easements).

---

### Regulation of Tribe–U.S. Government Relationship

- **1778–1871: Treaty Era**
  - U.S. and Native nations make **treaties** (government‑to‑government).
  - Treaties are **reciprocal**: both sides have binding duties.

- **1871–present: Statutory Era**
  - Congress no longer makes Indian treaties; instead passes **statutes** to:
    - Implement and manage treaty obligations.
    - Delegate management of tribal land/resources to federal agencies.

- **Treaty Abrogation**
  - **Congress** can end/modify a treaty only with **“clear and explicit intent.”**
  - **Tribes cannot unilaterally abrogate** treaties.
  - **Statehood does not automatically terminate treaty rights** (contrary to older case *Race Horse*, 1896, now disfavored).

---

### Doctrine of Trust Responsibility

- **Definition**
  - General **trust relationship**: the U.S. holds obligations to protect tribal interests, including sovereignty.
  - Case: **U.S. v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206 (1983)**.

- **Statutory Recognition**
  - **Indian Tribal Justice Support Act, 25 U.S.C. § 3601:**
    1. Government‑to‑government relationship with each tribe.
    2. U.S. has a **trust responsibility** to protect tribal sovereignty.
    3. Recognition of **self‑determination**, **self‑reliance**, and **inherent sovereignty**.
    4. Tribes have inherent authority to create their own governments and justice systems.

- **Enforcement Requirements (in federal court)**
  - Tribe must show:
    1. A **clear and specific obligation** owed by the U.S. (from statute, treaty, regulation).
    2. That the U.S. **violated** that obligation.
  - **More specific obligation → higher duty of care.**
    - **Fiduciary duty** = highest obligation.

- **Remedies**
  - **Damages** (money).
  - **Injunctive relief** (court orders to do or stop doing something).

### Fishing & Hunting Treaty Clauses

#### Treaty of Medicine Creek (1854), §3

- **Key language**
  - “The right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations, is further secured to said Indians **in common with** all citizens of the Territory…”
  - Also secures:
    - Temporary houses for curing fish.
    - Hunting, gathering roots and berries.
    - Pasturing horses on **open and unclaimed lands**.
  - Limits:
    - No shellfish from **beds staked or cultivated** by citizens.
    - Requirements about stallions (non‑central here).

#### Treaty of Neah Bay (1855), Art. 4

- **Key language**
  - Secures right of taking fish and **whaling or sealing** at **usual and accustomed grounds and stations**, **in common with** all U.S. citizens.
  - Temporary curing houses; hunting and gathering on **open and unclaimed lands**.
  - Similar shellfish limitation.

### Land Concepts: “Open and Unclaimed Lands” & Servitudes

- **“Open and unclaimed lands”**
  - Lands not privately owned/staked in a way that excludes public use.
  - Question: which specific lands qualify is a legal/ factual dispute in many cases.

- **Servitudes (e.g., Easements)**
  - **Non‑possessory interests** in land: right to use, not own.
  - Treaty rights (e.g., to hunt/fish on certain lands) often operate like **easements**.
  - **Private landowners only get what the U.S. could grant**:
    - If the land is already burdened by a tribal treaty right, buyers take **subject to that servitude** (U.S. v. Winans).

---

### State Authority Over Tribal Hunting & Fishing

- **On Tribal Land (Reservation or Tribal Land)**
  - States have **little to no authority** to regulate tribal members’ takings of fish and game.
  - Primary regulator: **the tribe itself**, subject to:
    - Treaties.
    - Federal statutes/regulations.

- **Non‑Tribal Individuals on Tribal Land**
  - States **may or may not** have some authority; depends on specific statutes/cases (not detailed here).

- **Off-Reservation (State Land) – Tribal Members**
  - **Treaties = federal law** → they **preempt conflicting state/local law**.
  - States *can* regulate off‑reservation treaty hunting/fishing for **conservation**, but only if:
    1. Regulation is **truly necessary** for conservation (not just convenient).
    2. It **does not discriminate** against tribal treaty rights (cannot single out or unduly burden tribes).

- **“North of Falcon”**
  - Reference to Washington State’s annual process of setting salmon seasons and allocations—important arena for applying these principles in practice.

  - Conflict over enforcement of treaty fishing rights (
