**Protections on Wildlife – Study Notes**

---

### 1. State Fish and Game Agencies

**Key concept:**  
State agencies get their power from **enabling statutes** (passed by the legislature) and must follow required procedures.

**Main questions when challenging agency action:**
1. **Wrong kind of power?**  
   - Legislature cannot delegate pure lawmaking without a guiding **“statement of policy.”**
2. **Beyond the bounds?**  
   - Agency cannot exceed what its **enabling statute** authorizes.
3. **Wrong procedures?**  
   - Even if within power, action can be invalid if it didn’t follow **required procedures** (notice, hearings, rulemaking steps, etc.).

### 2. Enforcement of Game Laws

**Issues in enforcement:**
- **Intent**  
  - How much mental state (mens rea) must be proven?  
  - Heavily affects whether conduct is criminal.
- **Prosecutorial discretion**  
  - Agencies often rely on prosecutors deciding **which cases to bring** and how harshly to pursue them.
- **Judicial interpretation**  
  - Courts interpret vague or broad statutes using ideas of **reasonableness**.
- **Challenging the statute itself:**
  - **Void for vagueness doctrine**: law is unconstitutional if people cannot reasonably tell what is prohibited.
  - **Overbreadth**: law sweeps in too much innocent or protected conduct.
  - **Fairness vs. enforceability**: stricter rules may be easier to enforce but risk being unfair.

### 3. Example: Hunting with Bait (Tennessee)

**Statute (Tenn. Code § 70‑4‑113) – simplified:**
“It is unlawful … to make use of … bait … used as or for food purposes … or other devices **for the purpose of killing, injuring, or capturing** protected birds or animals, except as otherwise expressly provided.”

**Issues raised by the hypotheticals:**
- Sprinkling corn and hunting **out of season**.  
- Sprinkling corn before season and then coming back **when season opens**.  
- Hunting in season where **you know** someone else has baited.  
- Hunting in season where someone else has baited and **you don’t know**.

**Key points/confusions:**
- What counts as “make use of bait”?
- How much **knowledge or intent** is required?  
- Does merely hunting in a baited area = “use of bait”?
- Distinction between **knowing vs. unknowing** presence in baited areas.

### 4. Enforcing Fish and Game Laws – Searches & Checkpoints

- **Game law checkpoints**  
  - Often used to check licenses, bag limits, and equipment.
  - Issue: Do they require **reasonable suspicion**, or are they more like border/DUI checkpoints (special‑needs exception)?

- **Curtilage of the home**  
  - The immediate area around the home with heightened privacy protection.  
  - Game wardens generally have **less authority** to enter curtilage without a warrant than to enter open fields.

### 5. Lacey Act

**Structure of a typical violation:**
1. **Predicate offense**  
   - Wildlife is unlawfully “taken, possessed, transported, or sold” in violation of **some other law** (state, tribal, foreign, or federal). [§3372(a)]
2. Then defendant **imports, exports, transports, sells, receives, acquires, or purchases** that wildlife.  
   - For state/tribal violations, must also involve **interstate or foreign commerce**.

**Mens rea tiers & penalties:**
- **Civil**:  
  - Standard: “In the exercise of due care **should know**” the wildlife is illegal.
- **Misdemeanor**:  
  - Above standard **plus** actually **knowingly engaged** in the conduct.
- **Felony**:  
  - Knowing engagement in either:  
    - the **purchase/sale** of illegal wildlife, or  
    - its **transportation across boundaries** (state or national).

**Pitfall:**  
People can be liable **even when the initial illegality is under another jurisdiction’s law**; the Lacey Act “federalizes” that underlying violation.

### 6. Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA)

**Coverage:**
- Applies to all birds designated as **migratory** by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS).
- **Does not** apply to **captive‑raised birds** (kept in captivity and not released).
- **Usually does apply** to birds that have been **released into the wild**, even if originally captive‑raised.

**Key issues:**
- **Direct vs. indirect killings**  
  - Direct: shooting a bird.  
  - Indirect: e.g., industrial operations causing bird deaths.  
  - Courts differ on how far indirect liability extends.
- **Duties of care**  
  - What precautions must regulated parties take to avoid killing migratory birds?
- **Problem of bait**  
  - Often treated as **strict liability**: no need to prove intent or knowledge in some contexts.

**Penalties:**
- **Misdemeanor**: basic strict‑liability or negligent violations.
- **Felony**: certain **knowing** violations (higher mens rea → higher penalty).

### 7. Hunting Migratory Birds – Regulations & Guidance

Sources:
- **Kentucky Hunting Guide for Migratory Birds and Waterfowl**
- **50 C.F.R. § 20 – “Migratory Bird Hunting”**

Questions to consider:
- How are rules communicated to ordinary hunters?  
  - Complexity vs. usability (tables, pictures, examples, checklists).
- Are the rules **clear** about:  
  - Legal/illegal baiting,  
  - Daily bag limits,  
  - Species ID,  
  - Shooting hours, equipment, etc.?
- Surprises:  
  - How detailed and **technical** the federal regulations can be relative to the **simplified state guides**.

**Common confusion:**  
Hunters may assume the **state guide = full law**, but federal rules (50 C.F.R. § 20
