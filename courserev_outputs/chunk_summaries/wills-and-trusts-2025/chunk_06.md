Key Concepts / Sections
------------------------

1. **Powers of the Court (Non-UTC/UPC States)**
   - Many non-UTC/UPC states give courts **similar powers** to UTC/UPC for *pet/companion animal trusts*:
     - Appoint someone to **enforce** the trust.
     - **Adjust** trust property if it substantially exceeds what is needed for the stated purpose.
   - Examples:
     - N.Y. EPTL § 7-8.1(a), (d).
     - Some states give courts **“blanket authorization”** to make additional orders to carry out the trustor’s intent, and instruct courts to consider **legislative intent**:
       - CA Prob. Code § 15212(d); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 3B:11-38(e); Wash. Rev. Code § 11.118.070.

2. **Enforcement of the Trust**
   - **Designating an enforcer:**
     - Trustor can name a person in the instrument to **enforce** the trust.
     - If no one is named, the **court may appoint** someone.
   - **Nevada** (NEV. REV. STAT. § 163.0075(3)):
     - Mirrors UTC § 408(2)(b): allows a person with an **interest in the animal’s welfare** to petition to be appointed.
     - Adds a safeguard: court must **give preference** to someone with a **demonstrated interest in the animal’s welfare**.
   - **Washington** (WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.050):
     - Allows a person with **custody** of the animal to enforce the trust.
     - Expands beyond: (1) persons named in the trust, and (2) court-appointed enforcers.
   - Study questions:
     - Does Washington’s “custody” standard protect animals as well as Nevada’s “demonstrated interest in welfare” standard?
     - Does having custody necessarily mean a genuine interest in welfare?

3. **Use of Property in Trust**
   - General rule: Property must be used **according to the trust terms**, consistent with UTC/UPC.
   - Variations:
     - **Delaware** (DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 12, § 3555(f)):
       - Care for the animal must be **“reasonable under the circumstances.”**
     - **Washington** (WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.030):
       - Trust property may be used to pay:
         - **Reasonable compensation** to the trustee.
         - **Reasonable costs** incurred on behalf of the trust.
       - This is allowed **even if the trust says otherwise** (statute overrides contrary trust terms).

4. **Duration of Companion Animal Trusts**
   - Many non-UTC/UPC states still use model language:
     - Trust lasts for **the life/lives of the designated animal(s)** (e.g., CA Prob. Code § 15212(a)).
   - Some states keep a **Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP) limit**:
     - Earlier of: **animal’s death OR 21 years**:
       - N.Y. EPTL § 7-8.1(a); Iowa Code § 633A.2105(1); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 3B:11-38(a).
   - **Washington**:
     - Incorporates its RAP: trust terminates **no later than 150 years** (WASH. REV. CODE § 11.98.130) – effectively not a constraint for animal trusts.

5. **Involvement of Interested Persons / Organizations**
   - States differ on **who can petition** the court concerning enforcement/admin of companion animal trusts.

   a. **No petition right**:
      - Some states provide **no mechanism** for persons/organizations to petition:
        - Iowa Code § 633A.2105; N.J. Stat. Ann. § 3B:11-38.

   b. **New York** (N.Y. EPTL § 7-8.1(a)):
      - Allows a person to apply to **appoint a trustee** if the trust instrument fails to appoint one.
      - No requirement that petitioner have any **welfare interest** in the animal.
      - No general power for the court to make **other orders to carry out the trust** (unlike UPC § 2-907(c)(7)).
      - Result: better than nothing, but **weak** at safeguarding against inadequate enforcement.

   c. **Idaho**:
      - Interested persons may bring an **action at law or equity** to enforce (IDAHO CODE ANN. § 15-7-601(7)).
      - “Interested persons” is **narrowly defined** (IDAHO CODE ANN. § 15-1-201(25)):
        - Those with a **property right** in the trust (e.g., heirs), not necessarily animal-welfare motivated.
      - Potential misalignment: persons with economic interest may not care about the animal.

   d. **More Protective States**:
      - CA, DE, IN, NV, WA:
        - Allow **persons with an interest in the animal’s welfare** to petition about enforcement:
          - CA Prob. Code § 15212(b)(3)(C).
          - DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 12, § 3555(c).
          - Ind. Code § 30-4-2-18(d).
          - NEV. REV. STAT. § 163.0075(3).
          - WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.050.
        - These statutes better align enforcement rights with **animal welfare goals**.

  - WA: Allows the **custodian** to enforce the trust, even if not named or appointed by court.
