Definitions / rules

1. Companion animal (pet) trusts vs honorary trusts
- Companion animal/pet trust:
  - Statutorily valid trust for a specific animal/animals.
  - Enforceable by a designated person or court-appointed enforcer.
  - Typically not subject to traditional “honorary trust” problems.
- Honorary trust:
  - Not enforceable at common law (no human beneficiary with standing).
  - Only valid if authorized by statute (e.g., for pet care or cemetery plots).
  - Must comply with RAP (cannot extend beyond applicable perpetuities period).
  - Transferee is not legally compelled to carry out the purpose; enforcement depends on transferee’s “honor.” If transferee declines, funds become the transferee’s property.

2. UPC vs UTC – pet/animal trusts
- Disposition of excess/unexpended property:
  - UPC § 2-907(c)(2):
    - Excess funds transferred, in order:
      1) As directed in the trust instrument;
      2) According to the trustor’s will;
      3) To the trustor’s heirs.
  - UTC § 408(c):
    - Court distributes excess property to the settlor or the settlor’s successors in interest (less specific hierarchy than UPC).
- Honorary animal trusts:
  - UPC: Provides for both companion animal trusts and honorary animal trusts.
  - UTC: Focuses on pet/animal trusts (no special separate honorary animal provision described here).
- UPC policy:
  - Encourages courts to construe pet provisions as companion animal trusts (enforceable) rather than mere honorary trusts.
  - Focus on trustor’s intent; permits extrinsic evidence to show the intent for stronger companion animal protections. § 2-907(b).

3. Enforcement of pet trusts (UPC vs UTC)
- UTC § 408(b):
  - Any person with an interest in the animal’s welfare can petition:
    - To appoint a person to enforce the trust; or
    - To remove an already appointed enforcer.
- UPC § 2-907(c)(4):
  - Interested individuals may petition court to appoint an enforcer only if none is designated in the instrument.
  - No express provision to petition for removal of a designated enforcer.

4. Typical features of state pet trust statutes (CA, CT, DE, ID, IN, IA, LA, NV, NJ, NY, OK, WA)
Common elements (similar to UTC/UPC):
- Trust instrument must:
  - State a specific purpose and specify the animal(s) covered.
- Instrument may:
  - Designate an individual to enforce the trust; failure to do so does NOT invalidate the trust.
- Court:
  - May appoint an individual to enforce the trust if the trust doesn’t.

5. New York pet trust statute – N.Y. EPTL § 7-8.1
Key provisions:
- Validity:
  - “A trust for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal is valid.”
- Enforcement:
  - Enforced by:
    - Individual named in the trust; or
    - If none, by an individual appointed by court upon application by:
      - Any individual, or
      - A trustee.
- Duration:
  - Terminates on the earlier of:
    - When no living animal is covered by the trust; or
    - 21 years.
- Use of funds:
  - Unless the instrument says otherwise:
    - No principal or income can be used by the trustee for self or for any purpose other than benefit of the animal.
- Disposition on termination:
  - As directed in the trust instrument; if no directions:
    - Property passes to the grantor’s estate.
- Excess funding:
  - Court can reduce the amount if it “substantially exceeds” what is required.
  - Reduction passes as unexpended property per the termination rule (i.e., to the grantor’s estate if no other direction).
- No trustee designated:
  - Court must appoint a trustee and may issue other orders to carry out transferor’s intent.

6. Idaho “purpose trust” – IDAHO CODE § 15-7-601
- A trust may be created for:
  - Any purpose, charitable or noncharitable.
- Noncharitable purpose trust:
  - May be created and is valid even if:
    - It would not be valid under common law (e.g., for lack of a traditional beneficiary).
  - “A purpose trust does not need a beneficiary.”
- Used to cover any “purpose” (includes but not limited to animal care).

Examples (from the text)
- New York pet trust:
  - Trust for the care of a named dog; valid.
  - Court may appoint an enforcer if the instrument doesn’t name one.
  - If trust is overfunded, court may reduce it; reduction goes to grantor’s estate.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming all “pet provisions” are enforceable:
  - At common law, many would be only honorary and unenforceable absent statute.
  - Modern statutes (UPC/UTC/state codes) aim to make them enforceable, but terms and remedies differ.
- Confusing UPC and UTC on:
  - Who gets excess/unexpended property (UPC’s three-step priority vs UTC’s “settlor or successors in interest”).
  - Who can seek removal of an enforcer (expressly allowed under UTC; not under UPC).
- Overlooking RAP / duration limits:
  - Honorary trusts and some pet trusts are limited by RAP-like constraints (e.g., NY’s 21-year cap even if the animal might live longer).
- Misunderstanding Idaho’s purpose trusts:
  - They explicitly need no beneficiary, which departs from traditional beneficiary requirement for private trusts.
