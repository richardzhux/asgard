# Chunk 04 (units 2461-3360)

**Key Concepts / Sections**

- **Noncharitable Purpose Trusts (Idaho)** – IDAHO CODE ANN. § 15‑7‑601  
  - A trust may be created **for any purpose, charitable or noncharitable**.  
  - A **noncharitable purpose trust**:
    - **Does not need a beneficiary**.  
    - Is enforceable **according to its terms** by a **named enforcer**.
    - **Failure to name an enforcer does NOT invalidate** the trust.
  - **Enforcement / Oversight:**
    - Named enforcer can **resign, be removed, or replaced** as provided in the trust.  
    - If there is no acting enforcer and no successor named:
      - **Trustee must apply to court** to appoint an enforcer or for directions.  
      - Court may appoint an enforcer and set rules for successors.  
    - While no person is acting as enforcer, the **court itself can exercise powers to enforce** the trust’s purpose.  
    - **Any “interested person”** (as defined in § 15‑1‑201(25)) may bring an action in law or equity to enforce.  
  - **Charitable trusts are excluded** – this statute applies only to **noncharitable** purpose trusts.  
  - **Retroactivity:** Purpose trusts created before July 1, 2005, are **valid and enforceable from creation**.

- **California Pet / Animal Trusts (Old vs. New Law)**

  - **Former statute (Cal. Prob. Code § 15212 – repealed)**  
    - Allowed a “trust for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal” to be **performed for the life of the animal**, regardless of:  
      - Whether a beneficiary could seek enforcement/termination, or  
      - Whether terms contemplated longer duration.  
    - Criticized as likely an **unenforceable “honorary” trust** if challenged.

  - **Current statute (as of 2018): Trusts for Care of Animals**  
    - **Nature of the trust (subd. (a)):**
      - A trust for the care of an animal is a **lawful noncharitable purpose trust**.  
      - **Default termination:** when **no animal alive on settlor’s date of death** remains alive, unless trust says otherwise.  
      - **Construction rules:**
        - Instrument must be **liberally construed** to:
          - Fit within the statute,
          - **Presume against merely precatory/honorary** disposition, and
          - Carry out **settlor’s general intent**.  
        - **Extrinsic evidence** of settlor intent is admissible.

    - **Use of property (subd. (b)(1)):**
      - Absent contrary terms, **principal and income may not be converted**:
        - To trustee’s own use, or
        - To any use **other than for the benefit of the animal**.

    - **Distribution on termination (subd. (b)(2)):**
      - Unexpended trust property is distributed:
        1. **As directed in the instrument**.  
        2. If created in a **nonresiduary clause** in settlor’s will/codicil: under the **residuary clause** of that will.  
        3. If (1) and (2) do not fully dispose: to **settlor’s heirs** under § 21114.

    - **Residuary clause treatment (subd. (b)(3)):**
      - For § 21110 (California’s anti‑lapse/future interests rule), the residuary clause described above is treated as creating a **future interest under the terms of a trust**.

    - **Enforcement (subd. (c)):**
      - Intended use can be enforced by:
        - A person **designated in the trust**, or  
        - If none, a person **appointed by the court**.  
      - Standing to petition the court (under § 17200 et seq.):  
        - Any person interested in the **welfare of the animal**, or  
        - Any **nonprofit charitable organization** whose principal activity is the care of animals.

    - **Trustee appointment (subd. (d)):**
      - If no trustee is designated or no one is willing/able to serve:
        - **Court must appoint a trustee**.  
        - Court may **order transfer** of trust property to the court‑appointed trustee if needed to carry out the intended use and no successor trustee is designated.
