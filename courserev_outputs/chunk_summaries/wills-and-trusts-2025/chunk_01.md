# Chunk 01 (units 1-900)

Key concepts / sections
- Modern “pet trusts”
  - Enacted in every state to avoid common-law problems with “honorary” pet trusts (no human beneficiary; RAP issues; discretionary enforcement).
  - States generally:
    1. Follow UTC § 408 (Trust for Care of Animal),
    2. Follow UPC § 2-907 (Honorary Trusts; Trusts for Pets), or
    3. Use their own/hybrid statutes incorporating elements of both.

Uniform Trust Code § 408 – Trust for Care of Animal
- Scope
  - Allows a trust “to provide for the care of an animal alive during the settlor’s lifetime.”
  - If multiple animals, all must be alive during settlor’s life.
- Duration
  - Trust terminates at:
    - Death of the animal, or
    - Death of the last surviving animal if multiple animals named.
- Enforcement
  - Enforced by:
    - A person named in the trust, OR
    - A person appointed by the court if none named.
  - “A person having an interest in the welfare of the animal” may:
    - Ask court to appoint an enforcer, or
    - Seek removal of the current enforcer.
- Use of property / excess funds
  - Trust property “may be applied only to its intended use,” i.e., care of animal(s).
  - Court can find that value exceeds amount needed for intended use; excess then:
    - Distributed to settlor if living; otherwise
    - To settlor’s “successors in interest” (default rule; can be altered by the terms of the trust).

- Adoption
  - Many states have adopted UTC § 408 or close variants (e.g., AL, AR, DC, FL, GA, KS, KY, ME, MD, MA, MN, MS, MO, NE, NH, NM, ND, OH, OR, PA, SC, TN, VT, VA, WV, WI, WY, etc.).
  - Exam focus is usually on the model (UTC 408), not memorizing every state.

Uniform Probate Code § 2-907 – Honorary Trusts; Trusts for Pets
- (a) Honorary noncharitable purpose trusts
  - Valid if:
    1. For a “specific lawful noncharitable purpose” or to select a lawful noncharitable beneficiary, AND
    2. No definite or definitely ascertainable beneficiary designated.
  - Duration:
    - May be performed by the trustee for up to 21 years (even if the instrument purports to be longer).
  - Classic example use (not detailed here but conceptually): trust to maintain a grave, monument, etc.

- (b) Trusts “for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal”
  - Validity
    - A trust “for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal is valid.”
  - Duration
    - Terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust.
  - Construction rules (very pro-enforcement):
    - Governing instrument “must be liberally construed” to:
      - Fit within the subsection, and
      - Avoid treating it as merely precatory or honorary.
    - Presumption against merely honorary intent.
    - Extrinsic evidence admissible to determine transferor’s intent.

- (c) Common provisions for honorary and pet trusts
  1. Use of property
     - By default, “no portion of the principal or income may be converted to the use of the trustee or to any use other than for the trust’s purposes or for the benefit of a covered animal,” unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise.
  2. Distribution on termination
     - Unexpended trust property is distributed:
       A. As directed in the trust instrument;
       B. If created in a nonresiduary clause of a will/codicil, then to the residuary clause;
       C. (Text cut off here, but usually: if no residuary or direction, by intestacy).

Pitfalls / common confusions
- “Honorary” vs. enforceable pet trusts
  - At common law, a noncharitable purpose trust with no human beneficiary was often unenforceable (“honorary” only).
  - UTC § 408 and UPC § 2-907 make pet-care trusts expressly valid and give enforcement mechanisms.
- Duration limits
  - UTC § 408: life of the animal(s) (no
