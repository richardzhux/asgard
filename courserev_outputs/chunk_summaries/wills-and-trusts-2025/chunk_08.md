# Chunk 08 (units 5741-5883)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - **Reduction of trust property based on animal’s needs**
    - Statute (example: Haw. Rev. Stat. § 560:7‑501(b)(5)) allows a court to **reduce the amount** held in a trust for a domestic or pet animal if it exceeds what is needed for the animal’s care.
    - Any **reduced/excess amount** passes as **unexpended trust property** (typically to remainder beneficiaries per the instrument or intestacy).

  - **Alternative planning method: Durable Power of Attorney (DPOA) for pet care**
    - Instead of (or in addition to) a pet trust, an owner can use a **Durable Power of Attorney for Property Management** to authorize an agent to care for animals.

- **Definitions / key ideas**
  - **Durable power of attorney (DPOA)**  
    A written instrument by which a principal authorizes an agent (attorney-in-fact) to act on the principal’s behalf, and the authority continues even if the principal later becomes incapacitated.
  - **Unexpended trust property**  
    Property remaining in the trust after the animal’s needs have been met (e.g., after a court reduces an overfunded pet trust or after the animal’s death), which passes according to the trust’s terms or applicable law.

- **Example (from text)**
  - **California Short Form DPOA clause for animals** (paraphrased):
    - The principal authorizes the attorney-in-fact, with respect to any animal the principal owns when the power is executed or acquires later, to:
      - Take actions the agent believes necessary or desirable to **effectively maintain the animal**, including:
        - Housing or arranging housing
        - Support and maintenance
        - Paying reasonable boarding, kenneling, and veterinary fees.
    - Source: 3 Cal. Wills & Trusts § 1.13 (1997).

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **Overfunding pet trusts**  
    - Courts may **reduce** an overfunded pet trust; the settlor’s intent to lavish large sums on a pet can be limited by statute.
  - **Trust vs. DPOA for pet care**
    - A **pet trust**:
      - Creates a funded fiduciary arrangement specifically for animal care.
      - Operates after the owner’s death and often during incapacity.
    - A **DPOA clause**:
      - Primarily operates **during the principal’s lifetime** (especially upon incapacity).
      - Does not itself create a separate fund; it just authorizes the agent to use the principal’s property to care for the animals.
  - **Scope of agent’s authority**
    - If the DPOA language is **too narrow**, the agent might lack clear authority to:
      - Board the animal long term,
      - Pay high veterinary costs,
      - Rehome the animal.
    - Clear drafting should expressly include housing, support, and veterinary care.
