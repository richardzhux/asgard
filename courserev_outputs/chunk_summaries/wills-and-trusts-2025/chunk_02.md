Definitions / rules

1. **Pet / Animal Trusts (UPC §2-907; UTC §408)**
   - **Valid purpose**: Care of a designated domestic or pet animal (UPC) / care of an animal alive during the settlor’s lifetime (UTC).
   - **Duration / Termination**:
     - UPC: Trust terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust.
     - UTC: Trust terminates upon the death of all covered animals.
   - **Enforcement**:
     - Both: 
       - May be enforced by a person named in the trust instrument OR appointed by the court.
       - An individual with an interest in the animal’s welfare can ask the court to appoint or remove the enforcement person.
   - **No extra fiduciary formalities (UPC)**:
     - Unless ordered by court or required by the instrument, no special filings, reports, registrations, periodic accountings, separate maintenance of funds, appointments, or fees are required just because it’s an animal trust.

2. **Unexpended / Excess Trust Property**
   - **Court reduction of overfunded trusts**:
     - Both: Court may reduce trust property if it substantially / clearly exceeds what is needed for the trust’s intended use.
   - **Distribution of excess / residue**:
     - **UTC §408(c)**:
       - If value exceeds amount required, court may adjust.
       - Unless otherwise specified, excess goes to the **settlor or the settlor’s successors in interest**.
     - **UPC §2-907(c)(2), (6)**:
       - If overfunded, court reduces transferred amount; reduced portion is treated as unexpended trust property.
       - Unexpended property is distributed in this strict order:
         1. As directed in the trust instrument;
         2. If created in a nonresiduary clause of the transferor’s will (or codicil), then under the **residuary clause** of that will;
         3. If no taker by (1) or (2), to the transferor’s **heirs** under intestacy (UPC §2-711).
       - For purposes of UPC §2-707, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust.

3. **Court’s Role and Powers (UPC §2-907(c))**
   - If no trustee designated, or designated trustee will not / cannot serve:
     - Court **must appoint** a trustee.
     - Court may transfer property to another trustee if needed to carry out the intended use and no successor trustee is available.
   - Court may:
     - Appoint an individual to enforce the intended use if none is designated.
     - Issue “other orders and determinations” as advisable to carry out the transferor’s intent and the statute’s purpose.

4. **State Adoption of UPC §2-907–Style Pet Trusts**
   - States listed as having adopted §2-907 or modeled statutes on it:
     - Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah.

5. **Honorary Animal Trusts**
   - UPC: Provides for **honorary animal trusts** in addition to pet (companion animal) trusts.
   - UTC: Does not separately mention honorary animal trusts (only pet/animal trust provision).

Examples (embedded in rules)
- **UPC distribution example**:
  - If T’s will gives $100,000 in a **specific (nonresiduary)** clause to a pet trust and the trust ends with $40,000 left:
    - First: distribute as the trust instrument directs.
    - If silent: that $40,000 passes under T’s **residuary clause**.
    - If no residuary taker: distribute to T’s **heirs** by intestacy.

Common pitfalls / confusions
- **Who gets leftover funds?**
  - Under UTC: default is **settlor or successors in interest**.
  - Under UPC: detailed waterfall (instrument → residuary clause → heirs). Don’t confuse these.
- **Scope of animals**:
  - Both cover animals alive during settlor’s lifetime, but UPC text emphasizes “domestic or pet animal.” Honorary trusts may cover other animals—know that UPC expressly allows these, UTC does not clearly parallel that.
- **Enforcement vs. trustee**:
  - The person enforcing the trust may be different from the trustee; courts can appoint either/both if not provided.
- **Formalities**:
  - UPC specifically relieves trustees from extra reporting/registration/etc. solely because it’s an animal trust—don’t assume additional statutory burdens.
