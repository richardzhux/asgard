# Chunk 07 (units 4921-5820)

- **Key Concepts / Sections**

  - **Enforcement of Companion Animal Trusts (Non-UTC/UPC States)**
    - Some non-UTC/UPC states offer **more protection** than the UTC default:
      - **CA, DE, IN, NV, WA** allow **“persons with an interest in the welfare of the designated animal(s)”** to **petition the court** regarding enforcement.
      - Typically petitions concern **appointment or removal of the trust enforcer** (modeled on UTC § 408(b)).
      - **California** goes further: allows **persons or nonprofit charitable organizations** to **inspect the animals, facilities, or trust records**.  
        - Statutes: CAL. PROB. CODE § 15212(b)(3)(C), (f); DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 12, § 3555(c); IND. CODE § 30-4-2-18(d); NEV. REV. STAT. § 163.0075(3); WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.050.

  - **Construction of Trust Terms in Favor of Valid Pet Trusts**
    - Some states direct courts to **construe terms to find a valid companion animal trust if reasonably possible**:
      - CA: CAL. PROB. CODE § 15212(a)
      - NV: NEV. REV. STAT. § 163.0075(1)
      - WA: WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.080
    - **Most other non-UTC/UPC provisions are silent** on favorable construction.

  - **Extrinsic Evidence of Settlor’s Intent**
    - Only a few non-UTC/UPC states **expressly allow extrinsic evidence** to determine intent for companion animal trusts:
      - CA: CAL. PROB. CODE § 15212(a)
      - WA: WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.080
      - OK: OKLA. STAT. ANN. tit. 60, § 199

- **Planning a Companion Animal Trust (Issues to Consider)**
  - **Information needed from client:**
    - Identification of animals, expected **life span**, **health** and **special needs**.
    - Desired **standard of care** (vet, boarding, grooming, food, lifestyle).
    - **Caretaker** and **trustee/enforcer** choice; backups; compensation.
    - **Funding amount** and how it was calculated.
    - What happens to **unexpended funds** (e.g., remainder beneficiary, charity).
  - **Contingencies:**
    - Animal predeceases settlor, or dies earlier than expected.
    - Caretaker or trustee becomes unable/unwilling to serve.
    - Acquisition of **new animals** after the instrument is executed.
    - Changes in the **cost of care** (inflation, medical advances).
  - **Ensuring testamentary intent is honored:**
    - Draft **clear language** about:
      - Purpose of funds.
      - Standard of living.
      - Remainder distribution.
    - If allowed by jurisdiction:
      - Include a **mission statement** or explicit guidance, but understand that if the gift is discretionary, **mission statements may not be legally binding**.
      - Use **extrinsic-evidence-friendly** provisions or jurisdictions when possible.
    - Consider giving trustees **limited, guided discretion** instead of unlimited discretion.

- **Example: Leona Helmsley / “Trouble” the Dog**

  - **Facts:**
    - Helmsley left **$12M** in trust for her dog **Trouble**.
    - Court reduced the trust to **$2M** based on an affidavit from the caretaker:
      - $2M sufficient for **>10 years** of highest-standard care, > twice dog’s expected lifespan.
    - Care: ~$100,000 total for Trouble, caretaker paid **$60,000/year** for services.
    - Remaining trust property reverted to **Helmsley family trust**.
  - **Mission Statement vs. Trustee Discretion:**
    - Helmsley’s **mission statement**: trustees should use assets first for **“care of dogs”**, then other charity.
    - Trustees **chose not** to allocate significant funds to dog-related charities.
    - Court held trustees had **sole discretion** under the governing instrument; mission statement not binding.
      - In the Matter of Helmsley, 930 N.Y.S.2d 177 (Sur. Ct. 2009).
    - Animal protection groups tried to intervene to enforce her wishes; court denied for **lack of standing**, Appellate Division affirmed.  
      - In the Matter of Rosenthal, 99 A.D.3d 573 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012).
  - **Key takeaway:**  
    - Courts may **reduce “excessive” pet trusts**, especially where statutes require funds to be **reasonable relative to the animal’s needs**.
    - A **mission statement** without corresponding **binding language** and limits on discretion may not control trustee behavior.

- **Judicial Power to Reduce “Excessive” Pet Trusts**

  - If a statute expressly requires measured funding vs. need, courts **must** or **may** reduce overfunding.
  - Even without such a statute, arguments:
    - For discretion: based on **waste**, public policy, or analogy to statutory schemes like Hawaii’s.
    - Against: respect for **freedom of disposition** and plain language of the trust.
  - **Factors** (when determining excessiveness):
    - Animal’s **expected lifespan**, health, foreseeable medical needs.
    - Desired **standard of care** and documented cost.
    - **Number** of animals.
    - Cost and duration of **caretaker compensation**.
    - Impact on other beneficiaries and any **reversion clause**.
    - Evidence of **testator’s intent** (text + admissible extrinsic evidence).

- **Statutory Example: Hawaii – Reduction of “Unreasonable Pet Trusts”**

  - HAW. REV. STAT. § 560:7-501(b)(5):
    - Court **may reduce** the amount transferred if:
      - It **substantially exceeds** the amount required for the intended use; and
      - Reduction causes **no substantial adverse impact** on the animal’s care, maintenance, health, or appearance.
    - The **reduced amount** passes as **unexpended trust property** (i.e., to remainder beneficiaries).
  - This codifies a **reasonableness check** and clarifies the **destination of the excess**.

- **Alternative Method: Durable Power of Attorney (POA) for Pet Care**

  - A **durable power of attorney for property management** can:
