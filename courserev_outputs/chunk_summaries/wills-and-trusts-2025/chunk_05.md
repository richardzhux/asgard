# Chunk 05 (units 3281-4180)

Key Concepts / Sections
- Pet/Animal Trusts (modern statutes)
  - Example: California Probate Code § 15212 (amended pet trust statute)
  - Other examples: New York, Idaho, Delaware, Washington, etc.
  - Often modeled on UTC § 408 and UPC § 2-907, but with state-specific variations.

California Pet Trusts – § 15212 (highlights)
- Court appointment of trustee:
  - If no trustee is named, or none is willing/able to serve, the court must appoint a trustee.
  - Court can order transfer of trust property to a court-appointed trustee to carry out settlor’s intent.
  - Court can make other orders it deems advisable to carry out settlor’s intent and the section’s purpose.
- Accountings:
  - Normal trustee accountings (Prob. Code § 16062) must be provided to:
    - Beneficiaries who would take if the animal were then deceased, and
    - Any nonprofit charitable corporation whose principal activity is animal care and that has requested accountings in writing.
  - Small trust exception: if trust assets < $40,000
    - No filing, report, registration, accounting, separate maintenance of funds, appointment, or fee solely due to the fiduciary relationship, unless otherwise ordered or required.
- Inspection rights:
  - The following may inspect:
    - Any beneficiary,
    - Any person designated by the instrument or the court to enforce the trust,
    - Any nonprofit animal-care organization (principal activity = care of animals).
  - Scope: may inspect the animal, its premises, and the trust’s books and records, upon reasonable request.
- Non-termination:
  - Trust not subject to termination under § 15408(b).
- Inapplicability of § 15211:
  - § 15211 (other honorary trust rules) does not apply to § 15212 trusts.
- Definition of “animal”:
  - “Domestic or pet” animal for whose benefit the trust is created.
- Policy / legislative intent:
  - Designed to make pet trusts enforceable and ensure pet owners’ wishes are respected.

Variations Among States (Non‑UTC / Non‑UPC jurisdictions)
States vary on:
1) Eligible animals
2) Court oversight/enforcement powers
3) Who can enforce the trust
4) Who can use trust property (funds or real property/dwellings)
5) Duration of the trust
6) Involvement of interested persons or organizations
7) Construction of trust terms
8) Admissibility of extrinsic evidence

Eligible Animals – Illustrations
- Idaho:
  - Very broad; modeled after UPC § 2‑907(a) honorary trust:
  - Trustor may designate any purpose for the funds (not limited to “pets”).
  - IDAHO CODE ANN. § 15‑7‑601(1).
- New York & California:
  - Require “domestic or pet” animals (mirrors UPC § 2‑907(b)).
  - “Domestic” may be narrowly defined by statute; potential exclusion of wild animals.
  - “Pet” is more subjective; may allow some exotic or non‑domestic animals depending on interpretation.
- Delaware and similar states:
  - “Animal” = “any nonhuman member of the animal kingdom but shall exclude plants and inanimate objects.”
  - Also require that the animal be alive at the settlor’s death (borrowing UTC § 408(a)).
  - Examples: DEL. CODE ANN. tit. 12, § 3555(a); IND. CODE § 30‑4‑2‑18(a); IOWA CODE § 633A.2105(2); NEV. REV. STAT. § 163.0075(1).
- Washington:
  - Does not track UTC or UPC language.
  - Allows trusts for “any nonhuman vertebrate animal.”
  - WASH. REV. CODE § 11.118.010.

Court Powers – General Pattern
- Similar to UTC/UPC:
  - Ability to appoint someone to enforce the trust if not designated.
  - Ability to reduce (“adjust”) trust property if the fund greatly exceeds what is reasonably needed for its purpose.
  - Example: N.Y. Est. Powers & Trusts Law § 7‑8.1(a), (d).

Examples (Embedded in Text)
- California:
  - Enforceable pet trust for “domestic or pet” animals with structured oversight (accountings, inspection rights, court‑appointed trustee if needed).
- Delaware:
  - Trust for any nonhuman animal, provided animal is alive at settlor’s death.
- Washington:
  - Trust may name any nonhuman vertebrate; not tied to UTC/UPC phrasing.

Pitfalls / Common Confusions
- “Domestic” vs. “Pet”:
  - “Domestic” may exclude exotic or wild species depending on statutory definition.
  - “Pet” is more flexible; courts may vary on how broadly they interpret it.
- Assuming UTC/UPC rules apply everywhere:
  - Non‑adopting states (NY, ID, CA, etc.) can be more generous or more restrictive; must check specific state statute.
- Enforcement:
  - Don’t assume only the trustee or human beneficiaries have standing:
    - Statutes often give standing to designated enforcers and animal‑care charities.
- Small trust exceptions:
  - For low‑value trusts (e.g., <$40,000 in CA), formal fiduciary requirements can be relaxed unless the court or instrument requires otherwise.
- Duration limits:
  - Some state statutes cap trust duration (e.g., life of animals), others track RAP or modify it; not uniform.
