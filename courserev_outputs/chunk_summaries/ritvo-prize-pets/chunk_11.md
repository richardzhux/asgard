  - Social meaning of pedigree, registration, and dog shows
  - Breed standards (“points”) and stratification

- **Core Ideas & Definitions**
  - **Mongrels vs pedigreed dogs**
    - Period discourse framed mongrels as socially inferior: “nobody now who is anybody can afford to be followed about by a mongrel dog.”
    - Pedigreed dogs are represented as “better than mongrels” and as the *norm* among “dogs of all kinds of the purest type.”
    - This language links **dog type** to **social status** of the owner.

  - **Institutionalization of the dog fancy**
    - **Dog fancy**: organized culture around breeding, exhibiting, and judging dogs.
    - **Pedigree registration** and **show judging** become formal institutions.
    - Keeping a **well-bred dog**:
      - Metonymically associates the owner with the **upper ranges of society** (the dog “stands for” the owner’s class).
    - The **structure of registration and judging**:
      - Metaphorically equates **owner with elite pet**: both occupy a carefully defined “elite” position in a hierarchical system.

  - **Stratified order**
    - Institutions of the fancy “projected an obsessively detailed vision of a stratified order.”
    - That order:
      - **Sorts animals** into finely graded categories (breeds, sub-breeds, etc.).
      - **Implies similar sorting of people** into “snug and appropriate niches.”
    - **Dog breeds split and re-split**:
      - Increasing specialization (more and finer breed distinctions).
      - Makes competition possible in narrowly defined classes.

  - **Breed “points”**
    - **Points**: a formal list of traits that define the **ideal specimen** of a breed.
    - Developed by **aficionados of each breed**.
    - They guide breeders’ efforts (what to select for).
    - They are **publicly ratified and enforced** at dog shows.

  - **Dog shows**
    - Function as the **enforcement mechanism** of standards:
      - Judges compare real dogs to the codified “points.”
      - Shows offer a “dizzying range” of classes/categories -> more opportunities to rank and sort.
    - Publicly stage and legitimize the **hierarchical order** of breeds (and by implication, of owners).

- **Examples (from text)**
  - Press commentary:
    - Early: emphasizes how common “dogs of all kinds of the purest type” had become.
    - Later: social warning that “nobody” of status should be seen with a mongrel.
  - Image reference:
    - A **street vendor with mongrel dogs** is contrasted with “pedigreed dogs,” underscoring class difference (elite purebred vs lower‑class mongrel).

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**
  - **Confusing biological value with social value**:
    - The text analyzes **cultural and class meanings** of purebred vs mongrel, not arguing that mongrels are biologically “worse.”
  - **Thinking breeds are natural categories**:
    - Ritvo stresses how breeds are **constructed and multiplied** via institutional decisions (splitting breeds, writing “points,” etc.).
  - **Missing the human analogy**:
    - The stratification of dogs is not just about animals; it **mirrors and justifies human class hierarchy**.
