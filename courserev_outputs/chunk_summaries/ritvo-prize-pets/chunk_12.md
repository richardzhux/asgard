# Chunk 12 (units 9021-9920)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - Dog fancy as a hierarchical social order
  - Historical shift in the meaning of “breed”
  - Functional vs physical (conformational) classification
  - Emergence of modern breeds in the 18th–19th centuries
  - Private vs public pedigrees and class exclusivity

- **Definitions / core ideas**
  - **Dog fancy**: The organized culture of breeding, classifying, and showing dogs, built around highly detailed standards and competitions.
  - **Breed (Victorian sense)**: A subspecies/race with clear, definable physical traits that:
    - are codified in a written “standard” or “points,” and  
    - reliably reproduce when bred only with each other (closed breeding).
  - **Functional classification** (earlier period): Dogs grouped by what they did, not how they looked (e.g., hunting, menial work, pet).
  - **Private pedigree**: Lineage records kept privately by elite owners, not entered in public studbooks or registries; used to maintain exclusivity rather than broad recognition.

- **Examples**
  - **Extreme stratification in shows**:
    - Multiple sub-breed classes → ranked hierarchy from non-placing dogs up to “Best in Show.”
  - **Tudor-era classification (Dr. Caius)**:
    - Only 17 dog “types,” e.g., Terrar, Harier, Bloudhound, Grehound, Mastive, Spaniel-gentle (lapdog), etc.
    - Grouped into three large utilitarian categories:
      - Hunting dogs
      - Pet dogs (only the spaniel-gentle)
      - Menial work dogs
    - “Mastiff” = any large dog; “spaniel-gentle” = any lapdog (broad, non-specific use).
  - **18th‑century sporting encyclopedia**:
    - Mixes function with **coat-color stereotypes**, e.g.:
      - Red-spotted dogs: “fiery, and hard to be managed”
      - Yellow dogs: “of a giddy nature, and impatient”
  - **Emergence of modern breeds (foxhounds)**:
    - Early 18th c. foxhounds seen as “mongrelly”; later become the most carefully bred dogs.
    - Consensus type develops informally among Masters of Fox Hounds (e.g., Quorn pack, Brocklesby strain).
    - 1795 Beachborough kennel records classify dogs by **kennel of origin** (strain-based identity).
  - **Elite control of bloodlines**:
    - 1848: James Brierly calls the earl of Derby’s bloodhound bitch a rare “real thoroughbred”; wants to mate her with his similarly exclusive male.
    - Aristocratic pug owners favor **exclusive private pedigrees**; avoid public registration so bloodlines stay socially restricted.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **Assuming modern breeds are ancient**:
    - Ritvo stresses that “breeds” as Victorians understood them are relatively recent constructs; earlier “types” do not map cleanly onto modern breeds.
  - **Equating earlier labels with modern breeds**:
    - Terms like “mastiff” or “spaniel” in Caius are generic functional labels, not specific modern conformational breeds.
  - **Thinking the system was purely “natural” or biological**:
    - The elaborate breed hierarchy and show system resulted from a deliberate “collective act of will and imagination,” not just discovery of pre-existing biological kinds.
  - **Overlooking class politics**:
    - Private pedigrees and resistance to public registries among elites (e.g., pug owners) show that pedigree systems are about social exclusivity as well as animal classification.
