# Chunk 26 (units 20501-21400)

Key concepts / sections  
- This chunk appears to be heavily corrupted OCR text; it does not contain recoverable sentences, concepts, or section headings.  
- No coherent structure (titles, paragraphs, or topic markers) can be reliably identified.

Definitions / formulas  
- None can be extracted from this fragment; the text is too degraded to determine any technical terms or definitions with confidence.

Examples  
- No clear examples, cases, or narratives are identifiable.

Pitfalls / common confusions  
- Do not try to infer course content from this chunk alone; it is not reliably legible.  
- Avoid assuming that repeated fragments or random capitalized words here reflect real key terms—they are almost certainly OCR noise.  

If you have adjacent chunks (25 and 27), reviewing them together might make it possible to infer what this missing section was about.
