# Chunk 29 (units 22961-23860)

Key concepts / sections
- Transformation of bulldogs
- Reconstruction and popularization of collies
- Role of breed clubs, standards, and fashion
- Class and “respectability” in dog fancying

Definitions / key ideas
- Declension (re bulldogs): Perceived decline from the earlier, more active, bull-baiting bulldog to the modern show bulldog, seen as passive and deformed.
- “Bar sinister”: Term borrowed from heraldry, used here to mean visible signs of crossbreeding (e.g., Gordon setter traits in collies), implying impurity of pedigree.
- Stud Book: Official register of pedigreed animals; once a breed is in it, breeding is oriented around recorded ancestry and show standards rather than work.
- “Arbitrary and conventional points”: Easily measurable traits (e.g., skull shape, ear set, color) used by clubs and judges, often at the expense of overall character, health, or working ability.

Examples
- Bulldogs:
  - Critics like George Jesse condemned show bulldogs as “disgusting abortions” and “deformities from foot to muzzle,” incapable of traditional bull-baiting.
  - Function (coping with a bull) had disappeared; new bulldogs were shaped purely by the aesthetic preferences of fanciers.

- Collies:
  - Originally: Scottish working sheepdogs valued for intelligence, loyalty, and warm coats suited to Highland winters.
  - By late Victorian era: Most popular pet dog in England; breed reshaped to fit fanciers’ figurative and aesthetic needs rather than work.
  - Institutionalization: By 1895, seven independent collie clubs; strong collie representation in the Kennel Club; all-collie shows.
  - Crossbreeding: Frequent crosses with Gordon setters to get fashionable glossy black-and-tan coats; experts could detect “traces of this bar sinister” (ears, head shape, heaviness).
  - Fashion-driven anatomy: 1890s craze for long, narrow, “greyhound type” heads with pointy noses. Critics said such dogs looked “inane” and “expressionless” and even claimed they lacked space in their skulls for normal collie intelligence.
  - Volatile standards: Because many pedigreed collies existed, fanciers invented fine-grained distinctions and rapidly shifting fashions; breeders repeatedly redesigned or restocked kennels to match winning types.

- Breed clubs and standards:
  - Specialist clubs were meant to protect breeds from fashion, but in practice they:
    - Lacked other clear guides to standards.
    - Emphasized easy-to-define, conventional points.
    - Neglected the overall character and working qualities of the animal.
  - Collie Club debate (1884): Proposal to group show collie classes by color was rejected:
    - Seen as too coarse and easy a distinction (wouldn’t produce “subtle” rankings).
    - Risked aligning collie fancy with color-bred small pets (mice, rabbits, guinea pigs), which were associated with vulgar, lower-class fanciers.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming pedigree always trumped fashion: In practice, fashion often overrode strict pedigree; breeders willingly “contaminated” strains to chase a look.
- Thinking breed clubs preserved traditional working types: Here, clubs often intensified fashion effects, codifying arbitrary show traits rather than functional qualities.
- Misreading “improvement”: Victorian “improvements” to breeds (e.g., exaggerated heads) could undermine intelligence, health, and working ability.
- Overlooking class implications: Color-based classification, acceptable for small “fancy” animals, was rejected for collies partly to maintain a more “genteel” image and distance collie fanciers from lower-status animal hobbies.
