# Chunk 27 (units 21321-22220)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - **Early imagery of dog breeds**
    - Illustration reference: *“pomeranian with an early [something], lacking many of the characteristics later associated with the breed”* from John Church’s *A Cabinet of Quadrupeds* (1805).
    - Shows that what is later called a “Pomeranian” did not yet have the modern standardized look; breeds are historically fluid.

  - **Bulldogs and class / respectability**
    - Bulldogs associated with **pot-houses** (low-class pubs); sometimes called the **“pot‑house dog.”**
    - Patrons/owners of such dogs were **“not among the better classes”**—the dog signals low social status.
    - A contemporary observer (likely a moralist or reformer) argued:
      - Keeping **sporting dogs** like spaniels, pointers, and even greyhounds caused **“no diminution in respectability.”**
      - But a man with a **bulldog** would “become profligate and debased” (moral degradation linked to the dog and its uses).

  - **Bulldogs and blood sports post‑1835**
    - After the 1835 legislation against **baiting and fighting**, the **“fighting and baiting propensities”** of bulldogs still continued.
    - Implies ongoing **illegal or informal blood sports**, and continuing opportunities for bulldogs to “show their stuff.”
    - Non-fighting bulldogs were said to be “principally bred by professional …” (sentence will continue in next chunk), suggesting a commercial breeding culture.

- **Definitions / clarifications**
  - **Pot-house dog**: colloquial label for bulldogs, stressing their association with low-class drinking establishments and blood sports.
  - **Sporting dogs**: spaniels, pointers, greyhounds—used for hunting and field sports; considered respectable for gentlemen.
  - **Fighting and baiting**: blood sports such as bull-baiting, bear-baiting, dog-fighting, and related activities.

- **Examples present**
  - Example contrast:
    - Respectable to keep: **spaniels, pointers, greyhounds.**
    - Disreputable to keep: **bulldogs** (linked to violence, gambling, “lower orders”).
  - Example of breed evolution: early 1800s **Pomeranian** illustration that does **not** fit the later, familiar Pomeranian type.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **Anachronism about bulldogs**: 
    - Easy to project the later image of the bulldog as a **patriotic, respectable national symbol** back onto the early 19th century.
    - In this period, bulldogs were still strongly tied to **blood sports and low status**, not yet to middle‑class nationalism.
  - **Static view of breed appearance**:
    - Assuming that modern breed standards existed in 1805; the Pomeranian example shows **major historical variation** in look and type.
  - **Assuming legal bans ended the practice**:
    - 1835 laws did not instantly end fighting/baiting; bulldogs’ “propensities” and the associated culture persisted beyond formal prohibition.
