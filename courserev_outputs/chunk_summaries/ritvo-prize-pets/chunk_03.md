- Dog literature and publishing boom
- Prices, pedigree, and social status
- Class tensions: aristocratic sporting dogs vs urban pet dogs

Definitions / core ideas
- Victorian cult of pets: Mid-19th‑century growth in intense emotional attachment to companion animals, especially among the middle classes, accompanied by new practices (feeding at table, dressing dogs, tolerating inconvenience to humans).
- Dog fancy / dog fanciers: Enthusiasts who selectively bred, exhibited, and invested in purebred dogs; associated with pedigrees, shows, and high prices.
- Sporting dogs vs pet dogs:
  - Sporting dogs: hunting and field dogs traditionally kept by rural elites; associated with aristocratic identity.
  - Pet dogs: small or decorative companion dogs kept primarily for pleasure, especially by urban middle-class owners.

Content and examples

1. Growth of middle‑class affection for pets
- Idea: Dogs seen as more loyal and virtuous than humans (e.g., Byron’s phrase “all the Virtues of Man without his vices”).
- Satire: Punch mocks dog lovers who:
  - Feed dogs from the table
  - Dress them in outfits
  - Let them inconvenience humans

2. Commercialization and new markets
- Street trade:
  - ~20,000 London street traders dealing in live animals by mid‑19th century
  - At least a dozen specializing in brass dog collars (6d–3s each).
- Crime:
  - Professional dog stealers kidnap pets and demand ransom.
  - In 1844, Londoners paid £2–£50 to redeem stolen dogs.
- Specialized products:
  - Spratts Patent Meat “Fibrine” Dog Cakes (“As supplied to the Royal Kennels”)
  - Ashworth’s Patent “Metallic Comb-Brush”
  - Boulton and Paul’s “Dog's House and Yard Combined” at £10 10s
  - Luxury services: 30s for monogram clipped in fur; £5 for satin wedding coat; up to £60 for gold/silver collars and ornaments.

3. Dog books and publishing
- Pre‑19th century: Very few dog books; mostly derivative of:
  - Johannus Caius, De Canibus Britannicus (1570; Eng. trans. Of Englishe Dogges, 1576) — an annotated list of Tudor dog types, basically natural history.
- 19th‑century boom:
  - Expanded middle-class market produces many new works.
  - Sydenham Edwards’s Cynographia Britannica (1800–1805) as key early example:
    - Handsomely illustrated, issued in parts.
    - Addresses both emotional and practical concerns of genteel pet owners.
- New features of dog literature:
  - Physical and moral descriptions of breeds.
  - Heartwarming / instructive anecdotes.
  - Often luxury objects themselves (status-display books).

4. Prices, pedigree, and status
- Rising value linked to purebred culture:
  - Vet Charles Rotherham attributes increase in London’s dog population (c. 1865–1887) to rising value of purebred dogs.
  - Fancy journals equate “high prices” with “progress of the canine race.”
- Example high prices (c. late 19th century):
  - Champion collies and St Bernards: £1,000
  - Prize fox terrier: offers of £375
  - Distinguished King Charles spaniel: £250
- More ordinary pedigree pets:
  - Popular breeds of “pet quality”: about 3 guineas.
  - “Sufficiently perfect” to win in least competitive shows: minimum £10.
- Interpretation:
  - These expenditures signal owner status more than dog status.
  - Keeping “idle animals” is a practice borrowed from the upper classes → middle-class petkeeping as social aspiration.
  - Certification and registration of pedigrees emphasize prestige, not emotional qualities.

5. Class boundaries and resistance
- Upper-class response:
  - Aristocrats notice middle classes copying their practices.
  - Some try to distinguish their own “traditional” fancying from new middle‑class pet fancy.
- Focus of aristocratic identity:
  - Typically on sporting dogs (linked to rural, landed life).
  - Scepticism or hostility toward purely decorative/urban pets.
- Example attitudes:
  - 1824, The Complete Dog Fancier (anonymous, “red‑blooded” author):
    - Explicitly excludes toy / lap dogs: dogs that “some fond ladies make their daily pastime, have no business in these pages.”
  - Many contemporary dog books quietly echo preference for “serious” (sporting) dogs over lapdogs.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Thinking Victorian petkeeping was purely sentimental:
  - Text stresses that love is only “part of the story”; economic, commercial, and status motives are central.
- Assuming pedigrees certify temperament:
  - Pedigrees and registration primarily serve social and prestige purposes, not emotional ones.
- Blurring class-based dog types:
  - Important contrast between:
    - Aristocratic, rural, sporting dogs (longstanding elite culture).
    - Middle-class, urban, decorative/companion dogs (newer, more controversial).
- Overlooking satire and criticism:
  - Elite and satirical sources often ridicule or resist middle-class pet practices, showing that the “cult of pets” was contested.
