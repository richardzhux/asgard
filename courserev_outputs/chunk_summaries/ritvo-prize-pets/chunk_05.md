# Chunk 05 (units 3281-4180)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **Aristocratic dog breeds & status**
    - Certain breeds (pugs, collies, bloodhounds, borzois, deerhounds) described as “aristocratic.”
    - Once labeled aristocratic, they received high-status treatment (profiles, portraits, heroization).
    - Status could “rub off”: admired people → admired breeds → ordinary fanciers who owned them.

  - **Fox-Terrier Chronicle as canine “society pages”**
    - A specialized periodical devoted to one breed (fox terriers).
    - Covered elite dogs like human high society:
      - “Portraits of Celebrated Terriers”
      - “Biographies of Celebrated Dogs”
      - “Gossip”
      - “Visits” = euphemism for matings
      - “Debutantes” = dogs’ first show appearances
      - Occasionally “Portraits of Fox Terrier Men” (owners/breeders).

  - **Class hierarchy mapped onto dogs**
    - Dogs described as of “high and low degree,” paralleling human class (e.g., “purebred English greyhound” vs “Kaffir cur”).
    - Fanciers wanted association with aristocracy and distance from “common people.”
    - Breeds linked to laboring classes (e.g., whippets with Yorkshire/Lancashire workers) struggled for genteel acceptance.

  - **Whippet example**
    - Recognized by Stud Book in 1892, but experts doubted it would become fashionable:
      - Poorly documented pedigrees.
      - Longstanding association with laborers; “surroundings” not of high social scale.

  - **Adopting “humble” dogs when class can be re-framed**
    - Toy spaniels bred both in East End and at Blenheim Palace: low-class production did not ruin their elite image.
    - Middle-class readers were urged to buy valuable dogs cheaply from distressed colliers (miners) unable to pay increased dog tax.
    - Prior working-class owners portrayed as temporary custodians, not rightful social “partners.”

  - **Belief that dogs recognize class (“caste”)**
    - Edward Jesse’s tale: Irish wolfdog allegedly recognized descendants of ancient Irish kings (mocked by Punch).
    - George Romanes’ anecdote: a retriever befriends a rat-catcher and his cur, but “cuts” them when his master arrives; Romanes claims this proves dogs understand “caste.”
    - Shows Victorian readiness to project human social hierarchies onto animal behavior.

  - **Class segregation in dog fancy institutions**
    - Fancying establishment stratified by class despite breeders existing at all levels of society.
    - Dog clubs had:
      - **Auxiliaries** for less genteel fanciers: lower fees, fewer privileges.
    - Dog shows:
      - Special “workingmen’s classes” with reduced entry fees.
      - Even dogs of same breed often competed only within their class-based categories.

  - **Mongrels / curs as socially and morally devalued**
    - As pedigreed dogs became more common, non-pedigreed dogs were lumped as “mongrels” or “curs,” viewed with contempt.
    - Earlier functional types (e.g. many from Caius’s 16th-c. list) would now be classified as mongrels.
    - Negative stereotypes:
      - Responsible for “ninety per cent” of canine mischief.
      - “Useless,” “miserable,” “rubbish.”
      - “Old dogs of a poor breed” said to become very dirty.
    - Any impurity (“lapse from purity”) enough to put a dog in this low category.

  - **Stereotyping “half-breeds”**
    - Warnings to prospective owners:
      - “Half-mongrel Pomeranian” = “perfect little brute”—heel-biter, coward.
      - Mongrel / badly-bred pug = “uglier, more selfish little beast.”
    - At best, such dogs might be loyal and useful to “farmer and grazier,” not to “elevated” society.

  - **Pets as markers of human distinction**
    - Manuals warned that choosing the “wrong” dog signals poor taste and lack of social distinction.
    - Everett Millais suggests such choices show “want of knowledge,” not poverty—implying that respectable people *could* afford better-bred dogs and that bad pets expose ignorance.

- **Definitions / terms**

  - **Fancier**: Enthusiast who breeds, shows, or collects specific animal breeds (here, dogs), often with status aspirations.
  - **Stud Book**: Official registry listing recognized breeds and pedigreed individuals.
  - **Cur / mongrel**: Non-pedigreed dog, mixed or unknown ancestry; strongly devalued in Victorian fancy discourse.
  - **Auxiliary (club)**: Subordinate branch of a dog club intended for lower-status members, with reduced fees/rights.
  - **Workingmen’s classes**: Special classes at shows for working-class owners; lower entry fees, separated competition.
  - **“Visits” (in periodicals)**: Code for breedings/matings among high-status dogs.
  - **“Debutantes”**: Dogs’ first show appearances, likened to upper-class young women entering society.
  - **Caste** (in Romanes’s sense): Borrowed from human social stratification; implies rigid, quasi-hereditary social rank.

- **Examples**

  - **Fox-Terrier Chronicle** using human social language:
    - “Portraits,” “celebrated” dogs, “gossip,” “debutantes”—treating dogs as social elites.
  - **Whippet**:
    - Working-class associations → doubts about acceptance as a “fashionable” breed.
  - **Miners selling dogs**:
    - Economic distress + increased dog tax → colliers forced to give up “pets of no small value”; middle-class readers urged to acquire them.
  - **Irish wolfdog / ancient kings**:
    - Illustrates credulity and desire to connect dogs with noble lineage.
  - **Retriever and rat-catcher**:
    - Used (dubiously) to “prove” dogs sense human caste boundaries.
  - **Half-mongrel Pomeranian / mong
