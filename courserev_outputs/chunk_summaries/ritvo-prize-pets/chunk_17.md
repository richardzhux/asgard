- Social transformation of dog fancying (respectability, gender, class)  
- Early history and rapid expansion of dog shows

Definitions / main ideas
- **Dog fancy / fanciers**: Enthusiasts who breed, exhibit, and compete with dogs; treat dogs as objects of connoisseurship and prestige rather than just working animals.  
- **Breed**: A category that must be clearly defined before pedigree and individual “quality” can be certified; 19th-century Britain saw rapid growth in recognized breeds.  
- **Championship classes / Champion**: Show classes at a high level; winning dogs can prefix their names with “Champion,” conferring prestige and signaling recognized excellence in type and pedigree.

Key details & examples
- **Growth in recognized breeds**
  - 1800: Sydenham Edwards lists only ~15 “permanent races,” explicitly excluding mixed types.  
  - Mid-19th century: William Youatt describes nearly 40 varieties (plus wild breeds), with ~¼ sub-breeds of greyhounds.  
  - A sporting encyclopedia: >60 breeds, including the confusing “Prairie Dog of North America” (shows category slippage).  
  - By late 19th century: Rawdon Lee’s *History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland* recognizes ~60 breeds.

- **Classification problems**
  - Boundaries between:
    - Different dog breeds  
    - Dogs and closely similar animals  
    were “uncertain,” making precise pedigree claims tricky.  
  - Examples of attempted systems:
    - Sporting encyclopedia: 6 broad types—wild dogs; greyhounds; hounds; fowling dogs; pastoral/domestic dogs; mastiffs and their kind.  
    - British Museum zoologist: affinity groups—wolves, greyhounds, spaniels, hounds, mastiffs, terriers.  
    - Rawdon Lee: simple sporting vs. nonsporting division (adopted by the Kennel Club for show and Stud Book classes).  
  - Crufts 1890 class 220: “stuffed dogs, or dogs made of wood, china, etc.”—illustrates awkwardness in categorization at shows.

- **Dog shows and social structure**
  - Shows **materialize** lists, categories, and family trees; they:
    - Display the range of breeds and the “purest type” of each.  
    - Define each dog by detailed class (breed, age, sex, color, past wins).  
  - Control mechanisms:
    - Dogs confined in labeled cages corresponding to program listings.  
    - Expected decorum from both dogs and owners during judging.  
    - Respectable, regimented atmosphere extended to the crowds, enhancing the prestige of dog fancying.  
  - **Prizes**: Awarded for “elegance and breeding,” not brute strength or speed—aligns with genteel values and opens participation to the middle/upper classes and women (“even ladies”).

- **Social rebranding of dog fancying**
  - Earlier association: 
    - Country squires (foxhounds, shooting dogs).  
    - “Rough” urban types (bulldog matches, greyhound races, betting).  
  - New association:
    - Respectable, ritualized competitions.  
    - Outlet for classed and gendered display of taste and status.

- **Origin and growth of modern dog shows**
  - 1859: First dog show in Newcastle (June 28), sponsored by gun-maker Mr. Pape.
    - Only 60 entries, 2 classes (pointers and setters—both gun dogs).  
    - Prizes came from Pape’s stock (commercial tie).  
  - A few months later: Mr. Brailsford organizes a larger show in Birmingham (sporting dogs); so successful it is repeated the following year, adding **13 classes for nonsporting dogs**—crucial step in including pets.  
  - 1865: Birmingham organizers form a company and build Curzon Hall as a permanent venue; shows “continue to flourish.”  
  - 1863:
    - First really large show (Chelsea, March) with >1,000 entries.  
    - First international dog show (London, two months later).  
  - 1871: Grand-scale shows spread to Scotland; first Scottish national show held in Glasgow.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- **Breed vs. function vs. type**: 19th-century classifications mixed anatomical similarity, work function (sporting vs nonsporting), and social prestige; systems were not standardized or scientific.  
- **“Prairie dog” issue**: Not an actual domestic dog breed but a rodent; its inclusion in a dog-breed list shows how loose and confusing category boundaries could be.  
- **Respectability**: Modern shows did not simply “celebrate dogs”; they managed class, gender, and respectability, transforming a previously rough, sporting/betting culture into a genteel hobby.
