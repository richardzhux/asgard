# Chunk 30 (units 23781-24680)

Key concepts / sections
- Distinction between working collies and show collies
- Breed standards as social markers (dog fancy)
- Transition to the “Cat Fancy”
- Biological and practical limits on cat breeding vs dog breeding
- Economic implications (prices, value of prize cats vs dogs)

Definitions / core ideas
- **Dog “fancy”**: Organized culture of breeding, exhibiting, and judging dogs according to formal breed standards.
- **Breed standards**: Arbitrary, codified criteria for judging pedigree animals; meant to make systematic competition and ranking possible.
- **Plasticity (of species)**: Degree to which a species can be shaped or varied in size, form, temperament, etc., via breeding.
  - Dogs = highly plastic.
  - Cats = relatively uniform except for coat traits.

Key points & examples

**Working collies vs show collies**
- Little overlap between:
  - Rough, working shepherds who bred collies for herding.
  - Affluent amateurs who bred collies for shows.
- Fanciers believed:
  - The collie’s “transplantation” to genteel settings improved its temperament.
  - The original working collie was rough, hostile to strangers, might attack neighboring sheep when not working.
  - Through “constant association with his superiors” the dog’s disposition was supposedly “immensely” improved, becoming fit for “elegant” surroundings despite “lowly origin” as a sheepdog.
- Implication: Human class hierarchy is projected onto animals (improvement through elite association).

**Breed standards and social status (dog fancy)**
- Newly codified standards privileged **rank by competition** (show results) over **rank by association** (who owns/keeps the dog).
- Arbitrary criteria + rapidly changing fashions in:
  - Favorite breeds.
  - Preferred types within breeds.
- These traits of the fancy **mirror Victorian social mobility**:
  - Status appears based on individual “accomplishment” but is unstable and needs continual reaffirmation.
- Fanciers as “self-created”:
  - Many rise in status through their dog-breeding success.
  - Their manipulation of dogs’ bodies is **self-referential**:
    - Goal: celebrate their own power to manipulate and refashion.
    - Less about functional standards like utility, beauty, or vigor.
  - Index of a paradox:
    - They aggressively reshape the social order through breeding and shows, yet they long for a stable place in that same order.

**Rise of the Cat Fancy**
- Early on, cats were **not** prestigious show animals:
  - When shown, usually tacked onto exhibits of rabbits or guinea pigs.
  - Those species (rabbits, guinea pigs) were judged mainly by superficial traits (fur length, color).
- **Dogs vs cats, biologically and socially**:
  - Dogs:
    - Extremely variable (size, shape, temperament, athletic ability).
    - This might seem to justify complex breed subdivisions.
  - Cats:
    - Members of *Felis domesticus* are quite similar except for coats.
    - Resist fine-grained subdivision; far less morphologically variable.
- Yet in **owner–pet relationships**, cats resembled dogs more than small ornamental animals:
  - Owners identified with their cats similarly to dog owners.
- Result: Cat advocates built a parallel set of institutions:
  - Shows, classes, standards, pedigrees—analogous to dog fancy structures.

**Breeding difficulties unique to cats**
- Cat mating habits:
  - Cats choose mates on their own, often unseen by owners.
  - This made it hard to:
    - Control parentage.
    - Directly shape the next generation’s traits.
- Contrast with dogs and livestock:
  - Dogs/livestock could usually be paired with designated partners for controlled breeding.
- Darwin’s view (1868):
  - Humans had done almost **nothing** by “methodical selection” and very little even unintentionally to shape domestic cats.
  - Main influences:
    - Keeping the prettiest kittens.
    - Killing adults that poached game.

**Consequences for early cat fanciers**
- Their engagement in breeding was more **passive**:
  - Less direct control over reproduction than dog breeders had.
  - Weaker, less visible evidence of their influence on the animals’ bodies.
- Difficulty maintaining **pure strains**:
  - A prize animal might not produce prize offspring.
  - Conversely, a superb show prospect might be found “prospecting among the garbage.”
- Economic effect:
  - Late Victorian prize cats were far cheaper than prize dogs.
  - £1–£2 counted as a “long price” even for kittens “good enough to win at a first-class exhibition.”

**Creation of cat breeds despite biology**
- Despite cats’ resistance to genetic manipulation and subdivision:
  - Cat fanciers still established **breed categories**.
  - Each breed was given:
    - Standards.
    - An internal hierarchy of animals.
- This mirrors the dog fancy’s use of **classification and show systems** to:
  - Impose elaborate status structures on a relatively uniform species.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Don’t assume:
  - Cats were always prestigious show animals; their rise as fancy animals is later and self-conscious.
  - Breed standards are purely about functional or aesthetic improvement; Ritvo stresses they often serve **social and symbolic** purposes (displaying fanciers’ power and status).
- Be careful not to:
  - Overread biological plasticity as the main driver of fancy institutions; for cats, the institutions arise *despite* low plasticity.
  - Confuse owner–pet identification (strong for cats and dogs) with ease of breeding control (much easier for dogs than cats).
