# Chunk 13 (units 9841-10740)

This chunk appears to be badly corrupted OCR text: it’s largely repetitions of letters (e.g., “SSS,” “SEES,” “RRR”), fragments, and no coherent sentences, concepts, or examples.

From this chunk alone, I cannot extract:

- Key concepts/sections  
- Definitions or formulas  
- Examples  
- Pitfalls or common confusions  

For useful notes, I’d need a different (cleaner) chunk of the “Ritvo Prize Pets” document, or the original PDF/page image for this section so it can be re-OCR’d.
