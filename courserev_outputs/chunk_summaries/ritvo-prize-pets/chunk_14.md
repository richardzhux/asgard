# Chunk 14 (units 10661-11560)

Key concepts or sections  
- This chunk appears to be almost entirely OCR noise: repeated letters, partial words, and non‑semantic fragments.  
- No coherent sections, arguments, or narrative can be reliably extracted.

Definitions or formulas  
- None present in a usable form.

Examples  
- None identifiable.

Pitfalls / common confusions  
- Do not try to infer concepts or arguments from this chunk: the text is too corrupted to reconstruct meaning.  
- Any “patterns” (e.g., repeated “SSS”, “SEE”, “RRR”) are artifacts of bad scanning/OCR, not course content.

If you have adjacent chunks that are more legible, those will be needed to recover actual material from “Ritvo Prize Pets.”
