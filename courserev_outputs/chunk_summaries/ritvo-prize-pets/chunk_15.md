# Chunk 15 (units 11481-12380)

This chunk appears to be almost entirely OCR noise and typographical corruption (repeated “SSS,” “RRR,” etc.) with no recoverable sentences, concepts, or terminology.

From this text:

- No clear key concepts or sections can be identified.  
- No definitions or formulas appear.  
- No examples are present.  
- No obvious subject matter is inferable beyond possible references to “tissues” and “language,” but even these are too fragmented to treat as reliable.

Pitfall:  
If you are compiling notes from the full document, don’t try to extract meaning from this chunk—treat it as unreadable and rely on other chunks for substantive content.
