# Chunk 23 (units 18041-18940)

- **Key concepts / sections**
  - **Breed clubs and standards**
    - Fanciers saw *cross and careless breeding* as causing breeds (e.g., Beagles) to “disappear.”
    - Problem: “no standard to breed to, and ... no two Beagle judges are of the same opinion.”
    - Principle: *where there was a name, there was a breed; where there was a breed, there had to be a standard*.
    - Clubs’ double task for Beagles:
      - “improve the make and look of the Beagle”
      - “render it more suitable for work”
    - Result: enforceable standards created; once rankings became predictable, Beagles’ **popularity and prestige increased**.
    - Ambiguity: unclear whether they “restored and improved” an old breed or **created** a new, standardized one.

  - **Bulldog as national symbol and show breed**
    - Early 19th c. writer Pierce Egan grouped bulldog with the **thoroughbred horse, game cock, and pugilist** as unique “productions of BRITAIN and IRELAND,” symbolic of **courage, toughness, and endurance**.
    - By 1900, bulldog was “amongst the most popular breeds”:
      - Pampered more than other dogs.
      - Puppies described as **delicate**.
      - Bulldogs seen as **indolent**, with poor appetite; owners coaxed them to eat because “a thin Bull Dog is an abomination.”
    - Popularity created an **identity crisis** among traditional fanciers:
      - Old bulldog not associated with a “fashionable crowd.”
      - Traditionally not a “ladies’ dog”; now praised for “kindliness of disposition.”

  - **Functional bulldog vs. fancy bulldog**
    - **Pre-1835 (bull-baiting era):**
      - “Bulldog” likely referred to a **functional type**, not a tightly defined breed.
      - Selective pressure came from **bull-baiting performance**:
        - Bulls charged with heads down → dogs had to be **low and nimble** to avoid horns.
        - Needed **strong jaws**, **courage** to leap at the bull’s face, **perseverance** to hold on to the nose.
      - Rank based on **prowess, not appearance**.
      - Portraits of famous bulldogs show **wide variation in size and shape**, some lacking the later “bulldog” facial look.
      - Later fanciers retroactively define the “bulldog countenance”:
        - Broad, projecting underjaw → strong, tenacious grip.
        - Wide nostrils “placed far back” → dog can breathe while hanging on.

    - **Post-1835 (after bull-baiting ban):**
      - Parliament outlaws bull-baiting in 1835 → bulldog’s **original function disappears**.
      - Within ~20 years, observers claim bulldog is “almost dying out.”
      - By 1874, when the **Bulldog Club** is founded, the breed is “at a discount.”
      - Near extinction also linked to bulldog’s association with **unsavory, low-status environments**, despite some elite exceptions (e.g., Lady Castlereagh driving with a large bulldog).

- **Definitions / key terms**
  - **Breed standard**: A written description of the ideal physical and behavioral characteristics of a breed, used by judges and breeders as a template.
  - **Functional type vs. pedigree breed**:
    - *Functional type*: category defined by work/performance (e.g., bull-baiting ability).
    - *Pedigree breed*: category defined by ancestry and conformity to a formal appearance standard.

- **Examples**
  - Beagle Club’s explicit aims and creation of standards → rising show success and popularity.
  - Bulldog’s transformation:
    - From low, agile, working bull-bait dog of varied appearance.
    - To standardized, heavily pampered show animal with a codified “bulldog countenance.”

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**
  - **Assuming historical continuity of modern breeds**:
    - Modern “bulldog” or “beagle” looks are often **not** what the name referred to in earlier centuries; earlier dogs could be much more heterogeneous.
  - **Mistaking retroactive descriptions for history**:
    - Later physical ideals (e.g., extreme underjaw, nose placement) are projected backward as if they always defined the bulldog.
  - **Ignoring social/class context**:
    - Near-extinction of bulldogs was not purely biological/legal; **class associations and moral stigma** around bull-baiting venues also reduced their desirability.
