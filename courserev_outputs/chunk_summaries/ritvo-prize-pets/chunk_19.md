# Chunk 19 (units 14761-15660)

- **Key concepts / sections**

  - **“Pre-historic” dog shows in public houses**
    - Before 1859, informal dog shows existed in taverns/public houses.
    - No formal classes or certified judges.
    - Participants acted simultaneously as exhibitors, spectators, and judges, arriving at a “noisy consensus.”
    - Landlords subsidized these gatherings to attract “doggy” customers.
    - Venues often overlapped with other animal-blood-sport spaces (rooms also used for rat-killing contests).

  - **Social status and concealment of low origins**
    - Sporting and fighting breeds were most common in tavern shows; even aristocratic toy breeds appeared there.
    - Lytton acknowledged early toy spaniel shows in low-status venues (Elephant and Castle, Eight Bells).
    - Dalziel notes that “polite circles” preferred to ignore the “sanded parlours” origins of dog shows—an analogy to people avoiding “tracing the pedigree too curiously” when it might expose lowly beginnings that clash with present prestige.

  - **Behind-the-scenes disorder vs. ideal of hierarchy and decorum**
    - Official shows aimed at order, rank, and hierarchy through formal judging.
    - Reality often undercut this ideal, both practically and symbolically.
    - 1863 Chelsea show:
      - Lavishly decorated hall masked poor animal provisions.
      - No water or dishes; inadequate cages; chains too short, causing owners to let dogs out.
      - Result: chaos and safety hazards, e.g., a retriever biting an elderly woman.

  - **Health and safety risks to animals**
    - Even when facilities were “reasonably” good, shows spread distemper, especially deadly to puppies.
    - Spectators could be abusive or careless (e.g., Birmingham cat show, 1875: spectator held lit cigar to nose of prize tom).
    - Travel risks via rail:
      - Animals suffered from cold, hunger, filth.
      - Dogs sometimes lost or died.
      - Carriage space described as a dirty “boot—rank with accumulated filth.”

  - **Administrative failures as a threat to the show’s purpose**
    - More serious to fanciers than physical discomfort were organizational errors that undermined fair judging.
    - At 1863 Chelsea show (Stonehenge’s second critique):
      - Dogs wore collars with owners’ names instead of anonymous numbers → risk of favoritism, bias.
      - Misclassification:
        - Retrievers mixed with setters.
        - Foreign dogs lumped indiscriminately.
        - Puppies placed on a bench listed in the catalog for “Wolf, brought from the Crimea.”
      - Such confusion damaged the ideal of clarity, order, and rank; some observers doubted judges’ honesty.

  - **Stated goals of public dog shows (from 1859 onward)**
    - Improve the various dog breeds.
    - Display model / ideal specimens.
    - Discourage breeding of mongrels.
    - Judging implications:
      - A prize is not only for the individual dog; it endorses:
        - The **strain** (line) as desirable breeding stock.
        - A **type** (standard of form/behavior) others should aim to reproduce.
      - Judges at major shows thus wielded large influence over breeding practices and breed standards.
      - The entire system depends on public confidence in:
        - Judges’ **honesty** (no corruption, favoritism).
        - Judges’ **discrimination** (competent, knowledgeable assessment).

- **Definitions / concepts**

  - **“Pre-historic age of dog shows”**: Dalziel’s term for informal, pre-1859 tavern-based shows without formal structure or official judges.
  - **Class** (in show context): A subdivision of entries grouped by breed, age, sex, or other criteria, in which dogs compete directly against each other.
  - **Strain**: A breeding line within a breed; a family or subgroup of animals sharing inherited traits.
  - **Type**: The idealized physical and behavioral standard a breed should conform to.

- **Examples**

  - Toy spaniel shows at:
    - Elephant and Castle (as early as 1834).
    - Eight Bells (1851).
  - Mismanagement incidents:
    - Retriever biting an elderly woman due to poor chaining/caging.
    - Cigar held to prize tom’s nose at 1875 Birmingham cat show.
    - Mislabelled bench “Wolf, brought from the Crimea” filled with puppies.

- **Pitfalls / common confusions**

  - **Assuming dog shows were always genteel**: The text emphasizes their roots in taverns and association with blood sports and low-status venues, contrary to later middle-/upper-class self-image.
  - **Thinking prizes only reward individuals**: In this period, awards signaled which **lines and types** should dominate future breeding, making judging decisions structurally powerful.
  - **Equating visible decor with good standards**: Ornate halls often concealed poor animal welfare and sloppy organization, undermining both ethics and the credibility of show results.
  - **Overlooking the importance of anonymity in judging**: Naming owners on collars (instead of using numbers) is flagged as a serious breach that could bias judges and erode trust in the system.
