# Chunk 25 (units 19681-20580)

This chunk appears to be severely corrupted OCR text: words are fragmented, sentences are not coherent, and no stable concepts, definitions, examples, or formulas can be reliably extracted.

From this specific chunk:

- **Key concepts/sections**: Not recoverable. There are no coherent headings, topic sentences, or continuous phrases that indicate a clear subject.
- **Definitions/formulas**: None legible.
- **Examples**: None that can be confidently identified.
- **Pitfalls/common confusions**:
  - Do **not** try to infer meaning from isolated recognizable words here; the context is too broken.
  - Treat this chunk as unusable for content review and rely on other chunks of “Ritvo Prize Pets” for actual course material.

If you provide the neighboring chunks (24 and 26), I can try to reconstruct what this section was likely covering from surrounding context.
