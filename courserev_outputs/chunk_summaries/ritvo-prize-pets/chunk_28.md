Key concepts / sections
- Rehabilitation of the bulldog’s reputation and social status  
- Rise of the bulldog as a show and pet animal  
- Lack of clear, functional breed standards in early Bulldog Club  
- Internal disputes over physical “points” (esp. Dudley nose)  
- Conflict between show aesthetics and animal function/health  
- Perceived change from fighting bulldog to “modern” bulldog

Definitions / important terms
- Bulldog Club: Victorian-era breed club attempting to redefine and standardize the bulldog as a respectable show pet rather than a fighting dog.  
- Dog-fanciers: People who bred and showed dogs; “professional dog‑fanciers” were seen as the lowest social tier of this world.  
- Dudley nose: Flesh-colored (non‑black) nose, often with light eyes and yellowish facial color, found in some fawn bulldogs; subject of a long controversy over whether it should disqualify a dog.  

Key points & arguments
- Reputation shift
  - Earlier authorities (Youatt, Van Amburgh) depicted bulldogs as nearly uneducable, purely ferocious, and mentally limited.  
  - Later writers re-frame bulldog ferocity as the result of “cruel purposes of depraved owners”; the dog’s “courage” is morally neutral or admirable, humans are to blame.  
  - This rhetorical shift helps make the bulldog acceptable to “respectable” fanciers.

- Social and show success
  - By 1885, bulldogs (as show dogs) rank second only to collies in popularity (entries).  
  - New image: “peaceable,” “intelligent,” even “benign‑looking.”  
  - Example: Champion “Bully McKrankie” marketed as a house-kept “great pet.”  
  - Bulldog-only shows draw large audiences (“gates”).

- Lack of coherent standards
  - New fanciers complain that available descriptions of “points” (ideal traits) are contradictory and confusing.  
  - Veteran breeders give confident but conflicting opinions on almost every feature.  
  - Indicates that the bulldog’s new purpose (show/pet) is not yet matched by a clear, rational standard.

- The Dudley nose controversy
  - 1884: Bulldog Club votes to exclude Dudley-nosed dogs from competition.  
  - Counterproposal (to make Dudley nose a requirement in fawn bulldogs) is defeated.  
  - Pro‑Dudley faction continues to lobby; press debates the issue.  
  - 1895 compromise: part-Dudley (part black, part flesh-colored) noses allowed to compete and even win if otherwise good.  
  - Outside experts like Rawdon Lee take a pragmatic stance: would not disqualify an otherwise good dog for Dudley markings.  
  - Illustrates how arbitrary, aesthetic rules could override practical concerns.

- Show standards vs. function/health
  - Some show judges want a bulldog that is “well out at the shoulder” and has a highly “broken up face” to be “distingué.”  
  - Rawdon Lee calls this shoulder structure a “crippling deformity.”  
  - Example: champion Dockleaf (owned by breeder Sam Woodiwiss) collapses after only a two‑mile walk—evidence of how extreme show standards impair health/function.

- Change from fighting bulldog to “modern” bulldog
  - General agreement that late Victorian bulldogs look different from their bull-baiting ancestors.  
  - Some (e.g., Stonehenge) praise the “modern bulldog” as “neater in shape.”  
  - Critics see degeneration: less active, “want of character,” “disgusting abortions” and “deformities from foot to muzzle,” allegedly unable to face a “veteran bull.”  
  - But this criticism is moot: bull‑baiting is gone; there are “no more bulls to cope with,” so the bulldog’s function has fundamentally changed.

Examples
- Bully McKrankie: Show champion advertised as a house pet, symbol of the bulldog’s new domestic role.  
- Dudley nose debate: Long-running intra-club fight over a purely cosmetic trait, revealing arbitrary standards.  
- Dockleaf: Champion bulldog whose inability to walk two miles exposes conflict between fashionable conformation and physical capability.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming show standards are based on functional excellence: In practice, many bulldog “points” are aesthetic and can conflict with health or working ability.  
- Thinking breed “improvement” is universally agreed upon: Victorian commentators are split; some see refinement, others see deformity and moral decline.  
- Treating dog traits as purely natural: The text stresses how human practices (cruelty, fancying tastes, club rules) construct both the bulldog’s behavior and its body.
