# Chunk 24 (units 18861-19760)

Key concepts / sections
- Illustration & caption
- Section heading: “Prestige and Pedigree”
- Historical point about dog breeds

Definitions / key points
- Mastiff (18th c.): Large, powerful guard dog type; in the period, not yet sharply standardized as a “modern” mastiff breed.
- Bulldog (18th c.): Bull-baiting / fighting dog; again, not yet standardized into the modern, compact, flat‑faced bulldog.

Examples
- Illustration from Thomas Boreman, *A Description of Three Hundred Animals* (1736):  
  - Shows a mastiff and a bulldog that are “hard to distinguish” from one another.  
  - Used by Ritvo to indicate that:
    - In the 18th century, “breeds” were more fluid and less visually distinct than today.
    - Modern, sharp breed boundaries (mastiff vs bulldog) are historically recent constructions.

- New section: “Prestige and Pedigree” (text largely illegible here) likely begins a discussion of:
  - How pedigrees and clearly defined breeds become associated with social status and prestige.
  - The increasing importance of lineage and standardized breed characteristics in the 19th century.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming modern breed features are timeless:
  - The caption explicitly warns that mastiffs and bulldogs were not easily distinguishable in the 18th century; current mental images of these breeds should not be projected back unchanged.
- Equating “breed” with a fixed biological category:
  - This example suggests that what counts as a distinct “breed” is historically constructed and can change over time.
