# Chunk 05 (units 3281-4180)

Key concepts / sections
- Oregon Constitution, Article I, § 9
  - Protects people “in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure.”
  - Applies only when government conduct amounts to:
    - a **search** (invasion of a protected privacy interest), or
    - a **seizure** (significant interference with possessory/ownership interests in property).

Definitions
- **Search (Art. I, § 9)**  
  - Occurs when government **invades a protected privacy interest**.
  - Privacy protected is **not** what a person merely “reasonably expects,” but the **privacy to which one has a right**, determined by:
    - social norms
    - legal norms (e.g., trespass laws, conventions against eavesdropping).  
  - Authority: *State v. Campbell*, 306 Or 157.

- **Seizure (Art. I, § 9)**  
  - Occurs when government action causes a **significant interference with a person’s possessory or ownership interests in property**.

- **Role of property concepts**
  - Property law concepts of **ownership** and **possessory rights** can inform:
    - whether a **privacy interest** exists in the property.
  - Privacy and property interests are related, but **not coextensive**.

Key cases and rules
- *State v. Owens*, 302 Or 196
  - Once property is **lawfully seized**, the state may:
    - **Without warrant**: “observe, feel, smell, shake, weigh” or otherwise thoroughly examine the **exterior** of the seized property.
    - **Interior examination** (to reveal hidden contents) is more restricted.
      - No warrant needed if:
        - contents are open to view, or
        - the item **“by its very nature announces its contents”** (e.g., by touch or smell).
      - Example: no warrant required to withdraw and test white powder **visible in a clear vial** to confirm it is cocaine.
  - “Not all containers merit the same protection under Article I, section 9.”

- *State v. Campbell*, 306 Or 157
  - Emphasizes that Art. I, § 9 privacy is about **legal/socially recognized rights**, not subjective expectations.

- *State v. Fessenden/Dicke*, 355 Or 759
  - Recognizes that **pets** occupy a “unique position in people’s hearts and in the law,” beyond the “cold characterization” of pets as mere property.
  - Applied **exigent circumstances** doctrine to seizure of an animal (horse) believed to be criminally neglected.
  - Notes that Oregon has **strong animal welfare statutes**, among the most protective in the nation.

Dogs as property vs special status
- Statute: **ORS 609.020** – “Dogs are hereby declared to be personal property.”
- General defense argument in the case:
  - A dog is like any other item of personal property (stereo, folder).
  - Under *Owens*, a **lawfully seized item** can be externally examined without a warrant.
  - Defendant analogizes dog’s body to a **closed, opaque container** whose “contents” (blood) are not apparent, so **withdrawing and testing blood** should require a warrant.
- Court’s response framework:
  - Not all personal property gets the **same level of constitutional protection**.
  - Pets/animals are different from inanimate objects:
    - Statutorily “property,” but subject to **distinct animal welfare protections** not applicable to inanimate objects.
    - Social and legal norms recognize a **special human–animal relationship**.

Application to Juno (the dog)
- Question: Did withdrawing and testing Juno’s blood **invade a protected privacy interest** or otherwise constitute an unlawful search under Art. I, § 9?
- Court must examine:
  - **Nature of the property**: a living animal, not an inanimate container.
  - **Circumstances of governmental intrusion**: blood withdrawal for testing after lawful seizure.

Examples (from text)
- *Owens* example:
  - Lawfully seized **clear vial** with visible white powder.
  - Police withdrawal and testing of the powder **did not require a warrant** because:
    - contents were **visible**;
    - vial “by its nature announced its contents.”

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing:
  - **Reasonable expectation of privacy** (subjective/expectational)  
  with  
  - **Privacy to which one has a legal right** (Art. I, § 9 standard in Oregon).
- Assuming:
  - All **property** (including animals) is treated **identically** for search and seizure analysis.
  - All **containers** (or container-like things) receive the same level of protection.
- Overextending the **“closed container” analogy**:
  - Treating a living animal exactly like an inanimate opaque container may ignore:
    - special **statutory protections** for animals,
    - social/legal norms about animals as more than mere chattels.
