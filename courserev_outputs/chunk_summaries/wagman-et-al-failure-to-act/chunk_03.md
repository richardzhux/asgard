# Chunk 03 (units 1641-2540)

Key concepts / sections
- Emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement
- Extension of emergency aid to animals (Fessenden / Dicke; applied again in this cattle case)
- Standards: subjective belief + objective reasonableness
- No probable cause requirement for emergency aid
- Application to facts: starving, dehydrated animals; delay vs “true emergency” argument

Definitions / rules
- Emergency aid exception (humans – Baker; generalized in Fessenden/Dicke):
  - Warrantless entry/search/seizure is permitted when:
    1. Subjective belief: Officers actually believe
       - there is an immediate need to aid or assist a person (or animal, per Fessenden) who has suffered or is imminently threatened with suffering serious physical injury or harm.
    2. Objective reasonableness: That belief is objectively reasonable under the circumstances.
  - Does NOT require probable cause that a crime has been or is being committed.
  - Focus is on:
    - immediate need,
    - serious physical injury/harm (or cruel death for animals),
    - reasonableness of officers’ actions.

- Emergency aid exception as applied to animals (Fessenden):
  - Applies when officers have an objectively reasonable belief, based on articulable facts, that:
    - a search or seizure is necessary to render immediate aid/assistance to animals
    - that have suffered, or are imminently threatened with suffering, serious physical injury or cruel death
    - unless that injury or death is being inflicted lawfully (e.g., lawful slaughter).

Key examples
- Fessenden (horse case):
  - Horse “near death from starvation,” in imminent danger of organ damage and falling, needed emergency medical care.
  - Court: Given imminent death and unnecessary suffering from starvation/organ failure, officer could reasonably conclude immediate steps were needed to save or alleviate suffering.
  - Result: Warrantless search and seizure of the horse upheld under emergency aid.

- Present cattle case:
  - Facts known to officers:
    - Hot July in Burns, Oregon.
    - Defendant away; cattle not cared for in at least a week.
    - Neighbors reported cattle lacked food and water, were starving, trying to escape, appeared “dying” and “near death.”
  - Officers (Glerup and Needham):
    - Subjectively believed immediate entry was needed to render aid.
    - Belief was objectively reasonable: facts supported belief that cattle were presently dying from starvation/dehydration and were near death.
  - Court’s reasoning:
    - As in Fessenden, given imminent death and unnecessary suffering (starvation), officers could reasonably decide to take immediate steps to save or alleviate suffering.
    - Under totality of circumstances, immediate aid was necessary; without it, the animals would suffer serious physical injury or death.
  - Result: Warrantless entry onto property and observations were valid under emergency aid exception; motion to suppress properly denied; conviction affirmed.

Defenses / counterarguments raised by defendant
- “No true emergency”:
  - Argument: Officers waited a day before entering, so they didn’t really believe there was an emergency.
  - Court’s response: Officers explained how their information and concerns escalated over time; considering all circumstances, emergency was real and aid was immediately necessary at time of entry.

- “Could have called back or gotten a warrant”:
  - Argument: Officers should have tried to contact defendant again or sought a warrant.
  - Court’s response:
    - Reasonable to believe cattle needed immediate aid when officers entered.
    - Officers acted immediately after learning cattle had no caretaker for a week.
    - Emergency aid exception exists precisely because waiting for a warrant (or extended contact attempts) can be inconsistent with immediate aid needs.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing emergency aid with probable cause:
  - Emergency aid is not about investigating crime; it is about preventing imminent serious harm.
  - No need for probable cause of criminal activity; standard is reasonableness of belief in immediate need for aid.

- Human-only misconception:
  - After Fessenden/Dicke, Oregon law clearly applies emergency aid to animals, not just humans, based on the same reasonableness principles under the Fourth Amendment and Article I, § 9 of the Oregon Constitution.

- “Delay kills the emergency” misunderstanding:
  - A short delay or change in officer conduct does not automatically negate an emergency.
  - Courts look at the totality of circumstances at the time of entry, including how information evolved and when the need for immediate aid became clear.
