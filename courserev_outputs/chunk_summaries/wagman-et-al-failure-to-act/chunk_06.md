# Chunk 06 (units 4101-5000)

Key concepts / sections
- Animals as property with special status
  - ORS 609.020: Dogs are declared to be property.
  - Generally, animals can be lawfully owned and possessed like other property.
  - But Oregon has one of the nation’s most protective animal welfare statutory schemes (Fessenden/Dicke).

- Distinctive legal status of animals
  - Animals are “sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, stress and fear” (ORS 167.305(1)).
  - Law permits some treatment of animals that would not be allowed for humans (e.g., killing for food, research, “good animal husbandry”).
  - Crucial point: Oregon law prohibits humans from treating animals in ways that humans are free to treat inanimate property.
    - You can abuse or destroy your stereo or car with no criminal consequence.
    - You cannot do the same to an animal you own or control.

Key statutory definitions / offenses
- First-degree animal abuse – ORS 167.330(1)
  - A person, with a culpable mental state, either:
    - Causes serious physical injury to an animal; or
    - Cruelly causes the death of an animal.

- Second-degree animal neglect – ORS 167.325(1)
  - A person, with a culpable mental state, “fails to provide minimum care for an animal in that person’s custody or control.”
  - Important: applies to anyone with custody or control, not only lawful owners.

- “Minimum care” – ORS 167.310(7)
  - “Care sufficient to preserve the health and well-being of an animal.”
  - Includes:
    - Adequate nutrition.
    - “[V]eterinary care deemed necessary by a reasonably prudent person to relieve distress from injury, neglect or disease.”

- First-degree animal neglect – ORS 167.330(1) (elevated offense)
  - Second-degree neglect becomes first-degree if the failure to provide minimum care results in:
    - Death, or
    - Serious physical injury.

- Limits on ownership and control of animals
  - Some animals cannot be lawfully possessed without restrictions:
    - ORS 167.365(1): Crime of dogfighting (owning, possessing, breeding, training, buying, selling a fighting dog).
    - ORS 609.341: Special permits required for “exotic” animals.
  - Limits on dominion/control:
    - ORS 609.098(1)(c): Unlawful to use a dog as a weapon in a crime.
    - ORS 811.200(1): Unlawful to carry a dog on certain parts of a vehicle without protection.

Privacy and possessory interests in animals
- Baseline principle:
  - An owner or lawful possessor of an animal has a protected privacy/possessory interest in that animal, like other property.
  - But what counts as an invasion depends on social norms and legal expectations.

Examples
- Example 1: Petting an off‑leash dog
  - Dog owner walks dog off-leash; dog runs to greet a passerby; passerby pets dog.
  - No violation of the owner’s possessory or privacy interests:
    - Falls within social norms.
    - Even if, by petting, the passerby discovers concealed facts (e.g., that the dog is emaciated).

- Example 2: Drawing blood from the dog
  - Same scenario, but passerby quickly takes a blood sample with a syringe (e.g., for a virus study).
  - This violates the owner’s possessory and privacy interests:
    - Falls outside social norms and expectations.
    - Even if motivated by scientific or public health concerns.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Confusing property status with full dominion:
  - Animals are property, but that does not give owners the same freedom they have with inanimate objects.
  - Statutes impose both:
    - Prohibitions on certain treatment.
    - Affirmative duties of care.

- Assuming neglect duties apply only to lawful owners:
  - Statutes impose duties on anyone with “custody or control,” not just legal owners.
  - Someone temporarily caring for or controlling an animal can be criminally liable.

- Overstating animal protection:
  - Although animals receive heightened protection relative to property, they are not legally on par with humans:
    - Many forms of killing/treatment of animals remain lawful (husbandry, research, slaughter).

- Misunderstanding privacy analysis:
  - Whether interference with an animal is a constitutional violation depends on:
    - The owner’s reasonable expectations of privacy and control.
    - Social norms about what types of contact with animals are acceptable.
