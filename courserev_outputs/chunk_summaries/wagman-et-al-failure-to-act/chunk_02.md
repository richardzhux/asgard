# Chunk 02 (units 821-1720)

**Key Concepts / Sections**

- **Facts (brief)**  
  - Officers received reports that defendant’s cattle looked starving and were trying to get out onto the road.  
  - Defendant had told officers that someone (Baron) was taking care of the cattle; Baron later told police that he had only agreed to check if cattle were on the highway, not to care for them.  
  - Officers, believing the cattle’s health and safety were in immediate danger and that no caretaker was present, entered the property without a warrant and observed evidence of animal neglect.  
  - Defendant was charged with animal neglect and moved to suppress all evidence from the warrantless entry.

- **Procedural Posture**  
  - State justified the entry solely under the **emergency aid doctrine**.  
  - Both sides accepted:  
    - The emergency aid doctrine exists under **Article I, section 9** (Oregon Constitution).  
    - A Court of Appeals case, **Fessenden**, had held that the doctrine can apply to **nonhuman animals**.  
    - They agreed on the *legal test*; disputed only whether the facts met that test.  
  - Trial court: found the doctrine applied; denied suppression.  
  - Defendant took a **stipulated-facts trial** on one count (preserving appeal on suppression), remaining counts dismissed.  
  - On appeal: defendant argues the state failed to show an applicable exception to the warrant requirement, specifically that **emergency aid** was not proven.

- **Article I, Section 9 (Oregon)**  
  - Protects against **unreasonable searches and seizures**.  
  - **Presumption**: Warrantless searches/seizures are **per se unreasonable** **unless** they fall under a **recognized exception**.  
  - Normally, officers need a **warrant to enter/search premises**.

- **Emergency Aid Exception – Definition (State v. Baker, 350 Or 641 (2011))**  

  - **General statement** (paraphrased):  
    - An emergency aid exception is justified when police have an **objectively reasonable belief**, based on **articulable facts**, that a **warrantless entry** is necessary to:  
      - render **immediate aid to persons**, or  
      - assist persons who have suffered, or are **imminently threatened** with suffering, **serious physical injury or harm**.

  - **Components the state must prove** (from Baker and this text):  
    1. **Subjective belief**: At the time of entry, the officers actually believed there was an **immediate need** to aid or assist a person (here, extended in Fessenden/this case to animals).  
    2. **Objective reasonableness**: That belief must be **objectively reasonable**, supported by **specific, articulable facts**.  
    3. **Nature of the harm**: The entry must be to address **serious physical injury or harm** that has occurred or is **imminently threatened**.  
    4. **Necessity of immediate action**: Circumstances must make it **necessary** to act without first obtaining a warrant.

- **Application to This Case (as described in the text)**  
  - **Evidence of subjective belief**:  
    - Officers testified they were “concerned about the health and safety” of the cattle, believed they were “possibly dying,” that “there was no apparent person taking care of the cattle,” and that immediate aid was needed to prevent “serious physical injury or death.”  
    - Both officers said they believed it was **necessary** to enter immediately, and one described it as their **duty** to ensure the animals’ safety.
  - **Evidence supporting objective reasonableness** (from officers’ perspective):  
    - Reports from two local individuals “very familiar with cows” stating that the animals were in “very poor health” and that they feared for their “safety and lives.”  
    - Information that defendant was out of town and no caretaker existed, contrary to defendant’s earlier claim about Baron.  

- **Examples / Illustrations in the Text**

  - **Example of “articulable facts”**:  
    - Emaciated appearance of cattle as reported by locals.  
    - Cattle trying to get out onto the road (suggesting distress and/or neglect).  
    - Conflicting information revealing that no one was actually caring for them.  

  - **Example of the legal mechanism**:  
    - Defendant’s **motion to suppress** is the vehicle to challenge the warrantless entry; the **state** bears the **burden of proving** that an exception (here, emergency aid) applies.

- **Pitfalls / Common Confusions**

  - **“Emergency aid” vs. generalized welfare checks**  
    - Not every concern about well-being justifies entry.  
    - The doctrine requires **immediacy** and **serious physical injury or harm**, not just long-term or speculative harm.

  - **Subjective vs. Objective**  
    - It’s not sufficient that officers *say* they were concerned; their belief must be backed by **specific facts** that would lead a **reasonable officer** to the same conclusion.

  - **Persons vs. Animals**  
    - Baker’s formulation speaks of “persons,” but later case law (Fessenden) and this case apply the doctrine to **animals**.  
    - Don’t confuse:  
      - the constitutional text (protecting people from searches),  
      - the **exception’s scope** (can be interpreted to allow entry to aid animals in some jurisdictions).

  - **Burden of Proof**  
    - The **state** bears the burden to justify a warrantless search under an exception; if the record is ambiguous, the default is that the search is **unreasonable**.

  - **Role of Trial Court vs. Appellate Court**  
    - Trial court: makes **findings of fact** and applies the doctrinal test.  
    - Appellate challenge here is to whether those findings and inferences **satisfy the legal requirements** of the emergency aid doctrine.
