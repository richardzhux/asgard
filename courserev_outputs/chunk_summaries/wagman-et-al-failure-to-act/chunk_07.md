# Chunk 07 (units 4921-5820)

Key concepts / sections
- Privacy interests in property depend on:
  - Nature of the property (here, a living animal vs inanimate object)
  - Nature of the intrusion (medical testing vs evidence-gathering search)
  - Circumstances of the intrusion (lawful seizure for neglect; medical need)

- Status of the dog under Oregon law
  - A dog is personal property → owner normally has dominion and control.
  - But animal property is *legally limited* in ways inanimate property is not:
    - Animal welfare statutes require minimum care, including veterinary care.
    - These limits reflect social and legal norms about animals’ welfare.

- Lawful seizure and protective custody
  - Officer had probable cause to believe the dog (Juno) was criminally neglected:
    - Near-emaciated; dry-heaving; eating random things in the yard.
    - Citizen report of neglect.
    - Owner’s admission she had no food for the dog.
  - Officer sought consent to take Juno for medical evaluation; owner refused.
  - Officer seized Juno over owner’s protest to:
    - Preserve evidence of neglect, and
    - Render aid / prevent further serious harm.
  - Under Fessenden/Dicke:
    - Warrantless seizure is permitted if:
      1. Probable cause of criminal neglect,
      2. Neglect is ongoing, and
      3. Seizure is necessary to prevent serious imminent harm.
  - Once seized, Juno was in the state’s protective custody; owner’s control was at least temporarily lost.

- Blood draw and testing
  - Dr. Hedge drew and tested blood to:
    - Diagnose whether a medical condition (other than lack of food) explained malnourishment.
    - Guide appropriate treatment (e.g., special feeding protocol when tests found no other cause).
  - Court’s conclusion: in this context, the blood draw and testing did *not* invade a constitutionally protected privacy interest of the owner.

Key definitions / doctrinal points
- Protective custody of an animal: state’s lawful control of the animal after seizure for neglect, with corresponding duty to provide care.
- Privacy interest in property:
  - Not absolute; shaped by what the property is, how it is intruded upon, and why.
  - Stronger for inanimate “containers” holding effects/info owner chose to conceal.
  - Weaker where “contents” are just the organism’s own physiology, especially when law recognizes welfare-based access for care.

Examples / illustrations
- Court rejects “container” analogy:
  - Juno is *not* like an opaque box containing separate items or information.
  - His “contents” (organs, tissues, blood) are “just more dog.”
  - The chemical composition of the blood:
    - Arises from internal physiological processes.
    - Is *not* “information” the owner placed “inside” to store or conceal.
- Contrast hypothetical examples:
  - Microchip ID in a dog:
    - Commonly used to identify animals.
    - Likely no privacy interest in such identification data (it is intended for external scanning).
  - Hypo: dog implanted with a microchip containing stolen secret government data:
    - In that scenario, there may be a protected privacy interest in the data, even if the dog itself was lawfully seized for some other reason.

Pitfalls / common confusions
- Assuming all property has identical privacy protection:
  - Animal property is treated differently from inanimate property because of welfare law.
- Treating a living animal like an inanimate “container”:
  - Owner did not “store” information/effects in the dog’s blood; thus the usual container-search analogies are inapt here.
- Ignoring context:
  - The same physical act (blood draw) could be analyzed differently if:
    - The animal were not lawfully seized, or
    - The purpose were purely investigative rather than medical/welfare-oriented.
