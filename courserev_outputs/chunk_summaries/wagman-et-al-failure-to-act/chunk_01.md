# Chunk 01 (units 1-900)

Key concepts / sections
- Distinguishing animal cruelty contexts
- Failure to act / neglect as animal cruelty
- State v. Hershey (Oregon Ct. App. 2017)
- Emergency aid exception to warrant requirement (re: animals)

Definitions / rules
- Animal neglect (general):
  - Failing to provide “minimum care” for animals (food, water, shelter, vet care).
  - Can be charged even for a single animal, but often involves many animals.
  - Can involve prolonged suffering (chronic pain, disease) over months/years.

- First-degree animal neglect (Oregon, ORS 167.330):
  - Criminal charge for serious neglect of animals; here, based on cattle allegedly starving and lacking water/food.
  - Failure to act (not feeding/watering) can be the criminal conduct.

- Emergency aid exception (to warrant requirement):
  - Allows warrantless entry if officers reasonably believe immediate entry is necessary to provide emergency aid.
  - In Hershey: applied to animals (cattle), not just humans.
  - Standard: “specific and articulable facts” leading to a reasonable conclusion that entry is necessary to give emergency aid.

Case example: State v. Hershey
- Facts:
  - Neighbor reports: defendant’s cows “starving,” with “no water or food.”
  - Sheriff’s deputy (Needham) investigates; can’t see cattle from highway due to terrain.
  - Defendant, reached by phone, says cows are “okay,” claims he fired prior caretakers but arranged for new caretaker (Baron).
  - Next day, experienced rancher neighbor (Scott Hauck) calls sheriff, reports:
    - Cows very thin, appear to be starving, no food.
    - Cows trying to get out to obtain food/water.
    - In his opinion, “near death.”
  - Other neighbors say they threw hay over fence because cows “looked like they were starving”; cows coming down road toward gate trying to get out.
- Procedural posture:
  - Defendant moves to suppress evidence from officers’ warrantless entry onto property (Article I, § 9, Oregon Constitution).
  - Trial court denies motion, citing emergency aid exception (as interpreted in State v. Fessenden and Fessenden/Dicke).
  - Court of Appeals: affirms denial; officers had specific, articulable facts to believe emergency aid to cattle was needed.

Examples from the text
- Voelker hypothetical:
  - Three iguanas decapitated on TV and later eaten.
  - Used to raise the question: does purpose (food vs. entertainment) change whether an act is “cruelty”?

Key analytical questions / pitfalls
- Killing for food vs. other purposes:
  - Should the legal analysis of “animal cruelty” differ if the animal will be eaten (socially accepted) vs. killed for entertainment or shock value?
  - Motivation/purpose (food vs. sport vs. sadism vs. TV spectacle) may affect:
    - Whether conduct is “necessary” or “justifiable.”
    - How “worthy motive” and “reasonable object” are evaluated.
  - Courts must navigate tension between accepted practices (e.g., hunting, slaughter for food) and prohibitions on cruelty.

- Recreation vs. cruelty:
  - Where is the line between:
    - Legitimate recreation (e.g., hunting) and
    - Unlawful animal cruelty (e.g., certain pigeon shoots)?
  - Factors courts may consider:
    - Degree of pain and suffering vs. socially accepted justification.
    - Whether practices are regulated/recognized (hunting seasons, humane methods).
    - Whether suffering is “disproportionate to the end sought.”

- Failure to act as criminal conduct:
  - A common confusion is thinking cruelty requires affirmative acts (beating, torturing).
  - In neglect cases, omission (not feeding, not watering, not providing vet care) can be the crime.
  - Especially serious where suffering is prolonged and hidden (e.g., remote properties, “animal hoarding”).

- Fourth Amendment / state constitutional confusion:
  - Students may assume emergency aid exceptions apply only to humans.
  - Hershey (following Fessenden) shows that, at least in Oregon, emergency aid justifying warrantless entry can extend to animals when specific, articulable facts support an urgent need to prevent serious harm.
