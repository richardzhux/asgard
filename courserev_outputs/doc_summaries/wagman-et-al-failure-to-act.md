### 1. Animal Cruelty by Neglect / Failure to Act

- **Neglect as cruelty**  
  - Criminal liability can arise from **omission**, not just active abuse:
    - Failing to provide **minimum care**: food, water, shelter, necessary vet care.
    - Often involves **prolonged, hidden suffering** (hoarding, remote property).
- **Oregon offenses**
  - **Second-degree animal neglect (ORS 167.325)**:  
    - With culpable mental state, **fails to provide minimum care** for an animal in one’s custody or control.
  - **First-degree animal neglect (ORS 167.330)**:  
    - Second-degree neglect **+** results in **death or serious physical injury**.
  - **Minimum care (ORS 167.310(7))**:  
    - Sufficient to preserve health and well-being; includes adequate nutrition and reasonably necessary vet care to relieve distress.

- **Key question**: Killing/using animals for **food, research, hunting** vs. **entertainment or sadism**—courts weigh:
  - Social acceptance/legality.
  - Degree of suffering relative to the goal (“disproportionate to the end sought”).

### 2. Emergency Aid / Exigent Circumstances for Animals

- **Constitutional baseline (Oregon Art I, § 9 / 4th Amendment)**
  - Warrantless searches/seizures are **presumptively unreasonable** unless an **exception** applies.
- **Emergency Aid Exception (Baker; extended in Fessenden, Hershey)**
  - Warrantless entry/search allowed when:
    1. **Subjective belief**: Officer actually believes **immediate action is needed** to aid a person/animal suffering or imminently threatened with **serious physical injury or cruel death**.
    2. **Objective reasonableness**: Belief is reasonable, based on **specific, articulable facts**.
  - **No probable cause of a crime required**; focus is on preventing harm, not investigating.

- **Extension to animals (Fessenden / Dicke)**
  - Emergency aid / exigent circumstances applies to **animals**, grounded in:
    - Overall reasonableness.
    - Oregon’s strong animal welfare statutes and policy.

- **State v. Fessenden (horse)**  
  - Emaciated horse near death from starvation; emergency seizure without a warrant upheld.

- **State v. Hershey (cattle)**
  - Multiple reports: cattle **starving, no food/water, near death**, hot July, owner away, no caretaker.
  - Officers reasonably believed immediate aid was necessary; warrantless entry **upheld**.
  - Arguments rejected:
    - **“No true emergency”** because of a short delay.
    - Police “could have called again or gotten a warrant.”  
  - Court looks at **totality at time of entry**, not rigid timing.

- **Pitfalls**
  - Thinking emergency aid is only for humans.
  - Confusing emergency aid with **probable cause** or general “welfare checks.”
  - Underestimating the need for **specific, articulable facts**.

### 3. Privacy, Property, and Animals (Newcomb & Art I, § 9)

- **Art I, § 9 – Key definitions**
  - **Search**: Government invasion of a **protected privacy interest**, defined by **legal and social norms**, not mere subjective expectations (*State v. Campbell*).
  - **Seizure**: **Significant interference** with possessory/ownership interests.

- **Owens rule (containers)**
  - Once property is lawfully seized, police can:
    - Thoroughly inspect its **exterior** without a warrant.
    - Inspect its **interior** without a warrant only if contents are open to view or the object “by its nature announces its contents.”

- **Animals as property, but special**
  - ORS 609.020: Dogs are personal property.
  - Yet Oregon statutes:
    - Declare animals “**sentient beings**” capable of pain (ORS 167.305(1)).
    - Impose **duties of care** and criminalize abuse/neglect.
    - Limit how animals can be owned/used (dogfighting, exotics, using dogs as weapons, unsafe transport).

- **State v. Newcomb (Juno the dog)**
  - Dog lawfully **seized** on probable cause of neglect (emaciated, eating random objects, owner admitted no food).
  - Vet drew and tested **blood** to diagnose/treat.
  - Issue: Was the blood draw/testing a **search** of the owner’s “effects” requiring a warrant?
  - Holding:
    - No **protected privacy interest** invaded under Art I, § 9 or the 4th Amendment.
    - Dog is **not a container**; blood is “more dog,” not a separate item the owner stored or concealed.
    - Once lawfully seized for neglect, the state has a **duty to provide care**; owner can’t invoke privacy to block medically appropriate treatment.
  - Narrow scope:
    - Applies to **lawfully seized, neglected animals** and **medically appropriate diagnostic/treatment procedures**.
    - Does *not* generally authorize all invasive procedures or all data extraction (contrast hypothetical chip holding secret data).

- **Pitfalls**
  - Treating an animal exactly like an inanimate “closed container.”
  - Confusing **property rights** with **privacy rights**.
  - Overreading Newcomb beyond the specific neglect/medical-care context.

### 4. Criminal Neglect & Mens Rea Inference (Martinez, Texas)

- **Texas Penal Code § 42.09(a)(2) (old cite)**
  - Offense to **intentionally or knowingly fail unreasonably** to provide necessary food, care, or shelter for an animal in one’s custody.

- **Martinez v. State**
  - 83-year-old widow, minimal income, known for taking in strays.
  - One dog
