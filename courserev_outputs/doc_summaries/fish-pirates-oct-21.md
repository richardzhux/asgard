**Fish Pirates & Water Law – Key Takeaways**

---

### 1. Fish Pirate Era & Early Regulation

- **U.S. Commission on Fish and Fisheries (1873)**
  - Federal agency focused on **science, not regulation**.
  - Initial role: **investigative**—study fish populations, causes of decline.
  - Rapid shift to **fish culture**:
    - Operated **hatcheries** for commercially valuable species.
    - **Stocked** depleted waters to support fisheries.
  - Did **not** set catch limits, seasons, or gear restrictions.

- **States’ Regulatory Role**
  - Used their **police power** to regulate:
    - **Takings**: what species could be caught.
    - **Methods**: gear types (e.g., nets, traps), structures (weirs, fish traps).
    - **Timing**: closed seasons, spawning protections.
  - Contrast: states = regulators of fishing practices; federal = science + stocking.

### 2. Navigability & Public Access

- **Navigability for Access (Legal Concept)**
  - Defined primarily by **state law**.
  - Assessed based on conditions:
    - **Before human alterations** (e.g., before dams), or
    - **At time of statehood**.
  - If **legally navigable**:
    - Public often has rights of **navigation, boating, and sometimes fishing**.
    - The **bed of the waterbody** is typically **state sovereign property** under the **public trust doctrine**.

- **Public Trust Doctrine**
  - State holds certain resources (e.g., navigable riverbeds) **in trust for the public**.
  - Core protected uses:
    - **Navigation**
    - **Fishing**
    - **Access** (varies by state)
  - **Maryland & the Potomac River example**:
    - Maryland owns the **entire riverbed** and manages **oyster bars**.
    - But cannot **exclude Virginia’s or other states’ citizens** from using the river.
    - Analogous to **federal navigation servitude**: navigation rights override exclusionary ownership claims.

- **Human vs. Salmonid Navigability**
  - Based on NOAA (2007) **salmonid use map**:
    - Some waters are **navigable by fish** (for migration) but **not by boats**.
    - Others are **boat‑navigable** but **not used by salmon**.
  - Legal navigability for **public access** ≠ biological passage for fish.

### 3. Property Rights Along Water

- **Riparian Rights (Rivers & Streams)**
  - Belong to **owners of land bordering flowing water**.
  - Typically include:
    - **Reasonable use** of water (subject to other riparians).
    - Right to **fish from one’s property** into the stream, so long as:
      - Does **not impair** other riparian owners’ rights.
      - Does **not interfere** with public trust rights where they exist.

- **Littoral Rights (Lakes & Coasts)**
  - Belong to **owners on lakes or seas**.
  - Include:
    - **Shoreline access** (bathing, boating).
    - Sometimes right to **wharf out** to navigable depth.
  - **Non‑navigable lakes common‑law rule** (illustrative, not universal):
    - Each owner’s property may extend to the **center of the lake**.
    - States vary—this is **not a uniform rule**.

### 4. Examples & Visuals Referenced

- **Fishing gear/structures**: purse seine, gillnet, dip net, fishing weir, salmon fish traps.
- **Historic depictions**: 
  - 1904 “Diagram of a Salmon Fish Trap.”
  - 1916 “With the Trap Net Fishermen.”
- **Maps**:
  - Wadewitz, *The Nature of Borders*, pp. 56–59 (Potomac & borders).
  - NOAA 2007 **salmonid waterways** map.
  - Map of **Maryland oyster bars** in the Potomac.

### 5. Common Pitfalls / Exam Traps

- **Confusing federal and state authority**
  - 1873 Commission = **science & stocking**, not a regulatory body.
  - **States** controlled **gear, seasons, and harvest levels**.

- **Misunderstanding navigability**
  - It’s a **legal status**, not just whether a boat can float there today.
  - Must consider **historic navigability** (pre‑dam, pre‑alteration).

- **Ownership vs. access**
  - State may **own** navigable riverbeds yet:
    - Must honor **public trust** and **navigation servitude–like** principles.
    - Cannot always **exclude** other states’ citizens.

- **Overgeneralizing riparian/littoral rules**
  - The “to the center of the lake” rule for **non‑navigable lakes** is **state‑dependent**.
  - Private shoreline rights are **limited** by:
    - Other owners’ correlative rights.
    - Public trust rights where applicable.
