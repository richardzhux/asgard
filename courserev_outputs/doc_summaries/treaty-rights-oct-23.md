**Main Ideas / Structure**

- Legal status of tribes: “domestic dependent nations”
- Reserved Rights Doctrine (what treaties do/don’t do)
- Historical shift: Treaty Era → Statutory Era
- Treaty abrogation (how treaty rights can be ended/changed)
- Federal trust responsibility to tribes
- Hunting & fishing treaty clauses (key language and meaning)
- Land/servitude concepts (easements, “open and unclaimed lands”)
- State authority over tribal hunting/fishing (on/off reservation)

### Core Definitions & Doctrines

- **Domestic dependent nations**
  - Tribes are sovereign governments but in a dependent relationship with the U.S.
  - Neither fully independent foreign nations nor mere interest groups.

- **Reserved Rights Doctrine – U.S. v. Winans (1905)**
  - Treaties are grants **of rights from tribes to the U.S.**, not grants **to** tribes.
  - Tribes **retain (“reserve”) all rights not expressly given up**.
  - If treaty is **silent**, presume the tribe still holds the right.
  - Non‑Native landowners take title **burdened** by existing tribal treaty rights (like easements).

- **Treaty vs. Statutory Era**
  - **1778–1871 (Treaty Era)**: U.S. makes **treaties** with tribes (government‑to‑government, reciprocal duties).
  - **1871–present (Statutory Era)**: No new Indian treaties; Congress uses **statutes** to:
    - Implement/manage treaty obligations.
    - Delegate land/resource management to federal agencies.

- **Treaty Abrogation**
  - Only **Congress** can terminate or modify treaty rights.
  - Requires **“clear and explicit” intent**.
  - **Tribes cannot** unilaterally abrogate their treaties.
  - **Statehood does not automatically end treaty rights** (old case *Race Horse* disfavored).

- **Trust Responsibility – U.S. v. Mitchell (1983)**
  - U.S. has a **trust relationship** with tribes: duty to protect tribal interests, including sovereignty.
  - **Indian Tribal Justice Support Act, 25 U.S.C. § 3601** recognizes:
    - Government‑to‑government relationship.
    - Federal **trust responsibility** to protect tribal sovereignty.
    - Tribal **self‑determination**, **self‑reliance**, **inherent sovereignty**.
    - Inherent tribal authority to form governments and justice systems.

- **Enforcing the Trust in Federal Court**
  - Tribe must show:
    1. **Specific obligation** owed by U.S. (from treaty/statute/regulation).
    2. **Breach** of that obligation.
  - More specific obligation → higher duty of care; **fiduciary duty** = highest.
  - Remedies: **damages** and **injunctions**.

### Key Treaty Clauses & Land Concepts

- **Treaty of Medicine Creek (1854), §3**
  - Secures right of taking fish at **“usual and accustomed grounds and stations”** **“in common with”** all citizens.
  - Also: temporary fish‑curing houses; hunting, gathering, pasturing horses on **open and unclaimed lands**.
  - Limits: no shellfish from **beds staked or cultivated** by citizens.

- **Treaty of Neah Bay (1855), Art. 4**
  - Similar fish rights plus **whaling and sealing** at **usual and accustomed grounds**, **in common with** U.S. citizens.
  - Same structure on curing houses, gathering, and shellfish limitation.

- **“Open and unclaimed lands”**
  - Generally: not privately owned/staked so as to exclude public use.
  - Which lands qualify is often a factual/legal dispute.

- **Servitudes / Easements**
  - Treaty rights often operate like **non‑possessory interests** (easements) in land.
  - U.S. can only convey land **subject to** existing treaty servitudes (Winans).

### State Regulatory Authority (Hunting/Fishing)

- **On tribal land (reservation/tribal trust land)**
  - States have **minimal to no authority** over tribal members’ hunting/fishing.
  - Primary regulation: **tribes**, constrained by treaties and federal law.

- **Off‑reservation (state land), tribal members with treaty rights**
  - Treaties are **federal law** → **preempt conflicting state law**.
  - States may regulate **only for conservation**, if:
    1. Regulation is **necessary** (not just convenient).
    2. **Non‑discriminatory** (cannot single out/unduly burden tribes).
  - Practice context: WA’s “**North of Falcon**” process for salmon seasons/allocations.

### Examples / Context

- **U.S. v. Winans**: Non‑Indian land title subject to tribal fishing easements at “usual and accustomed” sites.
- **Nisqually Nation & Fish Wars**: Historical conflict over enforcement of treaty fishing rights (illustrates off‑reservation rights vs. state regulation).

---

### Common Pitfalls / Misconceptions

- Thinking treaties **grant** rights to tribes; doctrine says tribes reserved pre‑existing rights.
- Assuming **statehood** or later state law automatically extinguishes treaty rights.
- Believing states have broad power over **on‑reservation** tribal hunting/fishing—authority is very limited.
- Ignoring that land buyers may take property **burdened** by treaty servitudes.
