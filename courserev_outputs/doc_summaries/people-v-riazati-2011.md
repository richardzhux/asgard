**People v. Riazati (2011), 195 Cal.App.4th 514 – Exam-Oriented Summary**

---

### I. Big Picture / Main Ideas

- **Statute at Issue:** Cal. Penal Code § 597(b) – animal cruelty/neglect.
- **Charges:**  
  - 2 felony counts (dogs, rabbits)  
  - 4 misdemeanor counts (chickens, birds, guinea pigs, duck)  
  - One count per **species** in defendant’s care.
- **Issues on Appeal:**
  1. **Jury instructions** – whether it was error to allow conviction based on conduct creating a **high risk of great bodily injury (GBI)** rather than only risk of death.
  2. **Sufficiency of evidence** – whether evidence supported six neglect convictions.
- **Holdings:**
  - **Invited error** bars challenge to the gross negligence instruction (defense asked for it).
  - Instructions were **legally correct** anyway: § 597(b) covers high risk of **death or GBI**.
  - **Substantial evidence** supported all six § 597(b) convictions.
  - Judgment and restitution order **affirmed**.

### II. Core Doctrines / Definitions

- **§ 597(b) – Animal Neglect (as applied):**
  - A person with **care or custody** of an animal is guilty if, **in a grossly negligent manner**, they:
    - Deprive (or cause deprivation of) necessary **sustenance, drink, or shelter**, OR
    - Fail to provide proper **food, drink, shelter, or protection**, OR
    - Subject the animal to **needless suffering**.

- **Elements (per instructions in this case):**
  1. Defendant had **custody/responsibility** for an animal.
  2. Defendant committed a **grossly negligent** act or omission.
  3. That act/omission created a **high risk of death or great bodily injury** to the animal.

- **Gross Negligence (criminal):**
  - More than ordinary carelessness.
  - Acting in a **reckless way** that:
    - Creates a **high risk of death or great bodily injury**, and
    - A reasonable person would have known of that risk.
  - For § 597(b): a **grossly negligent act/omission** that inherently produces **danger to animal life or safety**.

- **Great Bodily Injury (GBI) – as used here:**
  - Significant or substantial physical injury (more than minor/moderate).
  - Court holds **risk of GBI** is enough; statute is **not limited** to risk of death.

- **Invited Error (jury instructions):**
  - A party cannot complain on appeal about an instruction **they deliberately requested** for tactical reasons.
  - Here: defense rejected “danger to animal’s life” language and **insisted** on “high risk of death or great bodily injury,” trying to increase the People’s burden → barred from later attacking that language.

- **Standard of Review – Sufficiency of the Evidence:**
  - **Substantial evidence** test:
    - View evidence **in light most favorable** to judgment.
    - Evidence must be **reasonable, credible, of solid value**.
  - Court does **not reweigh** evidence or judge credibility.
  - Even a **single witness** can suffice unless testimony is physically impossible or inherently improbable.

### III. Key Facts / Examples Supporting Neglect

- **Property/conditions (Feb–Apr 2008):**
  - ~90 animals: dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, chicken, duck.
  - Strong odors of feces, urine, ammonia; junk and stagnant water with insects.

- **Specific conditions:**
  - **Dogs:**  
    - Tethered German Shepherd without shelter, in mud, no observed food/water.  
    - Thin Boxer and German Shepherd; stagnant green water with bacteria and larvae; rotten dog food.
  - **Rabbits & Guinea Pigs:**  
    - Overcrowded pens; standing/living in their own filth.  
    - Feces “everywhere”; brownish or unreachable water; dead rabbit in cage.  
    - Many underweight and dehydrated; one rabbit with abscesses, tattered ears.
  - **Birds:**  
    - Overcrowded cages, stacked so upper birds defecate on lower birds.  
    - Food and water bowls contaminated with feces, algae; brownish‑green water.  
    - Inadequate shelter from temperature extremes.
  - **Duck & Chicken:**  
    - Emaciated, covered in feces; inadequate shelter and no proper bathing water.  
    - Vet opined **starvation** in the chicken.

- **Procedural facts:**
  - Multiple visits (Feb 28, Mar 8, Mar 21–22) with **warnings and corrective advice**; only minor or cosmetic improvements.
  - **Search warrant** executed April 16; 90 animals seized; conditions videotaped.
  - Prosecution vet linked conditions to **dehydration, malnutrition, disease risk, and suffering.**

### IV. Case Law / Instruction Sources

- **People v. Speegle:**  
  - Earlier § 597(b) case; approved instruction requiring a **grossly negligent act/omission that “caused danger to an animal’s life.”**  
  - Did not decide whether high risk of **GBI** also suffices.
- **People v. Brian; People v. Rodriguez; CALCRIM No. 970:**  
  - Provide **general gross negligence definitions** (high risk of death or GBI) that the trial court used by analogy.

### V. Pitfalls / Common Misconceptions

- **“Risk of death only” misconception:**
  - Wrong: § 597(b) does **not** require a high risk of death.  
  - Correct: **High risk of death OR great bodily injury** is enough; plus “needless suffering” language shows broad protective purpose.

- **Ordinary vs. Gross Negligence:**
  - Mere poor or suboptimal animal care is **not enough**; need **reckless, high‑risk** neglect.

- **Invited Error vs. Forfeiture:**
  - Failing to object = possible **forfeiture** (some review may remain).  
  - **Requesting** the instruction = **invited error** → usually bars appellate review entirely.

- **Appeal as a retrial:**
  - Appellate court **does not** second‑guess the jury’s weighing of defense vs. prosecution experts or lay witnesses.  
  - Defendant in Riazati argued no high risk of **death** but **did not** challenge sufficiency under the correct **GBI** standard, dooming the claim.
