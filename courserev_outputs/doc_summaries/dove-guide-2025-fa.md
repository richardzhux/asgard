**Overall Structure / Main Ideas**

- **Health & Handling**
  - HPAI (bird flu): spread via saliva, mucus, feces of infected birds; human risk low but flu‑like symptoms after handling birds → see doctor.
  - Safe handling: field‑dress outside, wear gloves, don’t feed carcasses to dogs, “breast out” is safest, disinfect tools/surfaces, no eating/drinking/smoking while cleaning.
  - Cook all game to **165°F internal**.
  - Don’t wear hunting gear around domestic birds; report suspected poultry cases to KY Dept. of Agriculture hotline.

- **Regulatory Framework**
  - Guide is a **summary**, not full law; full KRS/KAR at fw.ky.gov.
  - Fish & Wildlife Commission: 9 members, governor‑appointed, Senate‑confirmed; recommends regs.
  - Key contacts: info line, game violation line, fw.ky.gov.

- **Licenses & Permits**
  - License year: **Mar 1 – last day of Feb**.
  - Youth **<12**: no licenses/permits (except elk drawing app).
  - Major items:
    - Annual hunting/fishing, combo, Sportsman’s, Youth/Senior/Disabled/Senior Lifetime Sportsman’s.
    - Species permits: deer, turkey, elk quota, bear, sandhill crane, KY Migratory Bird/Waterfowl Permit, federal duck stamp.
  - Who needs what (high level):
    - Almost all hunters need a **hunting license** + appropriate **species permit(s)**.
    - **Migratory birds**: hunting license + **KY Migratory Bird/Waterfowl Permit** (except crows).
    - **Waterfowl (16+)**: add **signed federal duck stamp**.
    - Youth 12–15: hunting license but **no KY MB permit or duck stamp**.

- **Hunter Education & HIP**
  - Born **on/after Jan 1, 1975**: must have hunter ed card or one‑time exemption while hunting.
  - HIP survey: **required every year** for all migratory bird/waterfowl hunters, even on own land or license‑exempt. Complete via **My Profile** and write confirmation number on license/permit.

- **Federal / State Methods Restrictions**
  - Illegal methods for migratory game birds: rifles, pistols, >10‑ga shotguns, unplugged shotguns (>3 shells) except Snow Goose Conservation Order, traps, poison, live decoys, sink boxes, shooting from moving vehicles/boats/aircraft.
  - **Baiting**: illegal to hunt over or near bait; area remains baited for **10 days after** removal.
  - Wanton waste: must retrieve birds if possible and keep in custody.
  - Tagging: required if leaving birds with someone else; tag must list hunter info, species/number, dates.
  - Wounded birds reduced to possession must be **immediately killed** and count in limit.
  - Transport ID: for most species, a **feathered wing or head** must remain attached until reaching home/processor (doves exempt; collared‑doves need ID if claiming unlimited).

- **Key Definitions**
  - **Daily bag limit**: max you may take in one calendar day.
  - **Field possession**: what you can have while in the field or going from field to vehicle/camp/home (cannot exceed daily bag).
  - **Possession limit**: total you can possess anywhere (often 3× daily bag); does not allow exceeding daily bag on any one day.
  - **Wanton waste, baited area, tagging** as above.

- **Seasons & Limits (Highlights)**
  - **Webless migratory birds (2025–26)**: specific seasons/limits for dove, snipe, woodcock, rails, gallinules, sandhill crane, crow.
  - **Waterfowl (2025–26)**:
    - Early teal/wood duck, September Canada goose (two zones).
    - Regular duck/goose seasons with 6‑duck daily (species sub‑limits; pintail = 3; variable scaup).
    - Youth‑only and veteran/military‑only days.
    - Light Goose Conservation Order: no limits, no shell cap, electronic calls allowed, half‑hour after sunset, free permit + report required.

- **Shot Requirements**
  - **Waterfowl & sandhill cranes statewide**: **only USFWS‑approved non‑toxic shot**; no lead in possession.
  - Non‑toxic also required for all migratory birds on specified WMAs/NWRs (Ballard, Boatwright, etc.).

- **Special Species / Cases**
  - **Sandhill Crane** (quota): apply online in Sept; must pass ID test; 1–3 tags; telecheck each bird; post‑season survey or ineligible next year.
  - **Crow**: open seasons with no bag limit; electronic calls allowed; depredation outside season now requires federal authorization.
  - **Eurasian Collared‑Dove**: no bag limit, but due to ID difficulty, stop at 15 mourning/white‑winged; keep head/wing attached.

- **Public Dove Fields**
  - All public dove fields closed to access **Aug 15–sunrise Sept 1**.
  - No decoys (motorized/static) on public dove fields **before Oct 1**.
  - Many cooperative and quota fields; some mentor/youth‑only on Sept 1.

- **Waterfowl on WMAs / Special Areas**
  - General WMA rules:
    - No permanent blinds unless explicitly allowed; decoys & temporary blinds removed daily.
    - Often: **no entry before 4 a.m.**, shooting only to **2 p.m.**, must exit by 2.
    - Max **4 hunters per party**; spacing rules (often 200 yards between parties, 50 yards from property lines).
  - **Season‑long blinds / hunt sites** (Barkley, Barren, Doug Travis, Green River):
    - Assigned by pre‑season drawings; one permit per area
