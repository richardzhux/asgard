**Main Ideas / Sections**

- Course context: segment on **Pets and Probate – Care After Death**
  - Focus on: legal treatment of animals as property, post-death care, and mechanisms (replevin, cy pres, pet trusts).
- Key doctrinal tools:
  1. **Replevin** (property recovery)
  2. **Cy pres** (modifying charitable/testamentary intent)
  3. **Pet trusts** (UTC § 408 and UPC § 2‑907 approaches)

### Replevin – Travis v. Murray, 977 N.Y.S.2d 621 (2013)

- **Definition**
  - A cause of action for **wrongful taking or wrongful detention of chattel** (personal property).
  - Objective: recover **the specific item** (the chattel), not its monetary value.

- **Remedy**
  - Court issues a **writ of replevin**:
    - **Provisional**: temporary, pending final judgment.
    - **Permanent**: after final decision.
  - Focus is on **return of the exact property**, not on compensatory damages.

- **Example**
  - Pet custody dispute: party claims the other is wrongfully keeping the dog/cat.
    - Use **replevin** to recover the animal as property.

- **Pitfalls / Misconceptions**
  - Confusing replevin with damages:
    - Replevin = get the thing back.
    - Damages = money for the value or loss.
  - Confusing provisional vs. permanent writ:
    - Provisional relief can be reversed after a full hearing.

### Cy Pres – In re Capers Estate, 34 Pa. D&C2d 122 (Pa. Orphans’ Ct. 1964)

- **Definition**
  - **Cy pres** (“as near as possible”): doctrine for modifying **charitable trusts** (and some testamentary gifts) when original terms are:
    - **Illegal**
    - **Impossible**
    - **Impracticable** to carry out.
  - Court restructures the gift to **approximate the donor’s intent** as closely as possible.

- **Function / Process**
  - Typically invoked via a **petition** (often by the trustee).
  - Court does **not discard intent**; it adjusts the **methods or recipient** to honor the same broad charitable purpose.

- **Example structure**
  - Will leaves money to support an institution that is now illegal/defunct.
    - Court redirects funds to a **similar, lawful institution** serving the same general goal.

- **Pitfalls / Misconceptions**
  - Cy pres is **not** a license to ignore donor’s wishes.
  - Generally limited to **charitable-type purposes**, not ordinary private gifts to individuals.

### Pet Trusts – UTC § 408 vs. UPC § 2‑907

**1. UTC § 408 – Care for an Animal**

- **Scope**
  - Trust for care of an **animal alive during the settlor’s lifetime**.
  - Ends at death of the **last surviving covered animal**.

- **Enforcement**
  - By a **person named in the trust**, or
  - By a **court‑appointed enforcer** if none named.
  - Other interested persons can ask court to appoint/replace the enforcer.

- **Funding Limits**
  - Court may reduce trust if it **exceeds what is needed** for care.
  - **Excess** goes to **successors in interest** (as defined by trust instrument/default trust law).

---

**2. UPC § 2‑907 – Honorary Trusts; Trusts for Pets**

- **Scope**
  - Trusts for care of **any designated domestic or pet animals**.
  - Terminates when **no living animal** is covered by the trust.

- **Enforcement**
  - By person named in the instrument, or
  - By a court‑appointed enforcer.
  - Others may request appointment; court can modify terms to best effectuate **transferor’s intent**.

- **Funding Limits**
  - Court may reduce if funding **substantially exceeds** what is needed.
  - Explicit order for **excess funds**:
    1. As the **trust instrument** directs.
    2. Under the **decedent’s will**.
    3. To **intestate heirs** (if will is silent).

### Comparison & Common Traps

- **Similarities (UTC & UPC)**
  - Both recognize **valid pet trusts**.
  - Both provide for an **enforcer** (named or court‑appointed).
  - Both allow courts to **reduce overfunded** pet trusts.

- **Key Differences**
  - **Scope language**
    - UTC: animals **alive during settlor’s lifetime**.
    - UPC: any **designated domestic or pet animals** (broader phrasing).
  - **Excess distribution**
    - UTC: to **successors in interest** (less specific; look to instrument/trust law).
    - UPC: structured priority—trust → will → heirs.
  - **Reduction standard**
    - UTC: funds **exceed** what is needed.
    - UPC: funds **substantially exceed** needs (higher threshold).

- **Exam pitfalls**
  - Mislabeling replevin as a damages action.
  - Treating cy pres as discretionary disregard of intent, instead of **intent‑preserving modification**.
  - Ignoring the **different standards for overfunding** and **different default recipients of excess** under UTC vs. UPC.
