**Neglect and Obligation – Core Outline (Nov 4)**

---

## 1. Main Ideas / Structure

- **Emergency Aid Doctrine**
  - When officers may enter property without a warrant to provide immediate aid.
  - Extension from humans to animals (state-dependent).

- **Search and Seizure Framework**
  - OR Const. art. I, § 9 and U.S. 4th Amendment.
  - Role of state vs. federal constitutional analysis in animal welfare cases (e.g., Newcomb).

- **Property Rights vs. Statutory Animal-Protection Duties**
  - Traditional dominion over property vs. legal duties to provide minimal care.
  - “Custody or control” as the key link to criminal liability.

- **Criminal Neglect Doctrine**
  - Neglect via omission (failure to act).
  - Mens rea requirements (“intentionally or knowingly”) in cruelty/neglect statutes.
  - Examples: Martínez (TX) and Riazati (CA).

## 2. Key Definitions / Rules

### Emergency Aid Doctrine (State v. Hershey; Fessenden/Dicke)

- **Rule (human-focused, Hershey):**
  - Warrantless entry is allowed if an officer reasonably believes:
    - Entry is necessary to **render immediate aid** to a person
    - Who **has suffered** or is **imminently threatened** with **serious physical injury or harm**.
  - No need for probable cause that a crime has occurred.

- **Extension to animals (Fessenden/Dicke):**
  - Same doctrine can apply to animals:
    - Officers may enter to prevent **serious injury or death** to animals.
    - Exception: where the injury/death is inflicted **lawfully** (e.g., lawful slaughter), but:
      - **Starvation is not lawful** → can justify emergency entry.
  - **State-specific**: Some states accept, limit, or reject this extension.

### Search and Seizure (State v. Newcomb)

- **Oregon Constitution, art. I, § 9:**
  - Protects against unreasonable searches/seizures of:
    - “Persons, houses, papers, and effects.”
  - Warrants require:
    - Probable cause
    - Oath/affirmation
    - Particular description of place and person/thing.

- **U.S. Constitution, 4th Amendment:**
  - Parallel protections and warrant requirements at the federal level.

- **Key doctrinal point:**
  - **State constitutions may give more protection** than the federal floor.
  - In cases like Newcomb, Oregon courts can interpret art. I, § 9 more broadly than federal 4th Amendment precedent.

### Property Rights vs. Statutory Protections

- **Rights of dominion and control:**
  - Traditional property right to **use and control** animals as property.

- **Custody or control (neglect statutes focus):**
  - Liability often attaches to anyone who has **custody or control**, not just legal title.
  - You may be criminally responsible even if you:
    - Are not the owner,
    - Lack formal “lawful possession,” but still exercise **control**.

- **Examining the “interior” of property:**
  - The state can look inside the private sphere when **statutory duties** (e.g., animal welfare) are implicated.
  - Property rights are **not absolute**; they are limited by animal-protection laws.

- **Minimal care obligations:**
  - Statutes can set a floor of “**minimal care**” (food, water, shelter, vet care) based on legal/social norms.
  - Failure to meet this floor can trigger **criminal liability**, overriding bare property-based discretion.

## 3. Criminal Neglect Cases / Examples

### Martínez v. State of Texas, 48 S.W.3d 273 (2001)

- **Prosecutorial discretion:**
  - Prosecutors decide **whether and how** to charge (e.g., neglect vs. cruelty).

- **Neglect by omission:**
  - Criminal neglect can be **failure to provide minimal care**, not just active abuse.

- **Mens rea requirements (TX statute):**
  - **Intentionally:**
    - Conscious objective to engage in conduct or cause the result.
  - **Knowingly:**
    - Awareness that conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.
  - Draws line between:
    - **Unfortunate circumstances** (e.g., poverty without awareness/intent)
    - **Criminally blameworthy neglect** (aware and fail to act).

### People v. Riazati, 198 Cal. App. 4th 514 (2011)

- Another neglect/cruelty case, illustrating:
  - Tension between **property rights** in animals and **statutory duties of care**.
  - How California courts evaluate:
    - Proof of **intent/knowledge**
    - What circumstances amount to **criminal neglect**.

### Example: Starvation

- **Starving animals**:
  - Not a lawful method of allowing animal death.
  - Can support:
    - Emergency entry under emergency aid doctrine (where recognized).
    - Criminal charges for **neglect/cruelty** (failure to provide minimal care).

## 4. Common Pitfalls / Misconceptions

- **“Always need a warrant/probable cause”:**
  - Wrong. **Emergency aid doctrine** allows entry:
    - Without warrant
    - Without probable cause of a crime
    - To render immediate aid to persons (and in some states, animals).

- **“Property rights are absolute over animals”:**
  - Wrong. Statutes impose **minimal care obligations** that **limit** dominion and control.

- **“Only owners are liable”:**
  - Wrong. **Custody or control** can create duty and criminal liability regardless of formal ownership status.

- **“Neglect = any bad care / mere negligence”:**
  - Many statutes require **intentional or knowing** conduct.
  - Simple negligence, ignorance, or limited resources may be insufficient **without proof of required mens rea** (fact-specific).

- **“Animal exigent-circumstance rules are uniform”:**
  - Wrong. States differ on:
    - Whether emergency aid doctrine extends to animals.
    - How far warrantless entry to save animals is allowed.
