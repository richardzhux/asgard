**1. Big Picture / Main Ideas**

- Common law: Noncharitable purpose trusts with no human beneficiary (e.g., pet care) were usually **“honorary” and unenforceable**; had to comply with RAP and depended on trustee’s “honor.”
- Modern statutes (UTC, UPC, and state acts) create **valid, enforceable pet/companion animal trusts**, solve RAP problems, and provide:
  - Clear **duration rules**
  - **Enforcement mechanisms** (enforcer, standing)
  - Rules for **excess/unexpended property**
  - Often **pro‑enforcement construction** of ambiguous provisions.

**2. Key Statutes and Structures**

- **UTC § 408 – Trust for Care of Animal**
  - Scope: Trust “for care of an animal alive during the settlor’s lifetime” (multiple animals all must be alive then).
  - Duration: Ends at death of the animal / last survivor.
  - Enforcement:
    - Enforcer named in trust or appointed by court.
    - **Any person with an interest in the animal’s welfare** may ask court to appoint or **remove** the enforcer.
  - Excess property: Court may reduce; default remainder = **settlor or successors in interest**, unless trust specifies otherwise.

- **UPC § 2‑907 – Honorary Trusts; Trusts for Pets**
  - (a) **Honorary noncharitable purpose trusts** (e.g., grave maintenance):
    - Valid for a specific lawful noncharitable purpose; no definite beneficiary.
    - Max duration: **21 years**, even if instrument says longer.
  - (b) **Pet trusts** (“designated domestic or pet animal”):
    - Valid; terminates when no covered animal is alive.
    - **Liberal construction**, presumption it’s enforceable (not merely honorary); **extrinsic evidence** admissible.
  - (c) Common rules:
    - Property must be used only for trust’s purpose / benefit of animals.
    - **Excess or unexpended property** waterfall:
      1. As directed in instrument;
      2. If from a nonresiduary will clause, then under the **residuary clause**;
      3. If still undisposed, to **heirs** by intestacy.
    - Courts: can appoint trustee/enforcer, reduce overfunded trusts, and issue other orders to carry out transferor’s intent.
    - No special fiduciary filings/accountings solely because it’s an animal trust.

- **Honorary vs. Pet Trust (definition contrast)**
  - **Pet/companion animal trust**: Statutorily valid, enforceable, and aimed at care of specific animals.
  - **Honorary trust**: No enforceable human beneficiary at common law; only valid as allowed by statute; usually within RAP; transferee not compelled to perform.

**3. Major State Approaches (Illustrative)**

- **New York – EPTL § 7‑8.1**
  - Valid trust for “care of a designated domestic or pet animal.”
  - Duration: Earlier of **death of last animal** or **21 years**.
  - Enforcement: Named enforcer or person appointed by court on application by **any person or a trustee**.
  - Use of funds: Default – only for animal’s benefit.
  - Termination/excess: As instrument directs; if silent, to **grantor’s estate**. Court may reduce “substantially excessive” funding.

- **California – Prob. Code § 15212**
  - Expressly recognizes animal-care trust as **noncharitable purpose trust**.
  - Duration: Until no animal alive on settlor’s date of death remains, unless instrument says otherwise.
  - Construction: **Liberally construed** to be valid/enforceable; presumption against honorary; **extrinsic evidence** allowed.
  - Distribution: Instrument → residuary clause → settlor’s heirs.
  - Enforcement/standing:
    - Designated person or court-appointed person.
    - **Any person interested in animal’s welfare** or animal‑care charity can petition and **inspect** animal, premises, and records.
  - Administration: Court must appoint trustee if none; accountings to remainder beneficiaries and qualifying charities; **small trust (<$40k)**: reduced formalities.

- **Idaho – Purpose Trust (IDAHO CODE § 15‑7‑601)**
  - Trust may be for **any noncharitable purpose**; **no beneficiary required**.
  - Enforced by a named enforcer; failure to name enforcer doesn’t invalidate.
  - If no enforcer, trustee seeks court appointment; court or any **“interested person”** (property‑interest based) can enforce.

- **Other State Variations**
  - **Eligible animals**:
    - NY/CA: “domestic or pet” animals (may exclude some wild animals).
    - DE, IN, IA, NV: “any nonhuman animal” alive at settlor’s death.
    - WA: “any nonhuman vertebrate animal.”
  - **Duration
