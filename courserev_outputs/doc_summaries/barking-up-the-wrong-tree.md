**Overview / Main Thesis**

- “Barking Up the Wrong Tree” critiques Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL) as:
  - Fear‑driven, media‑amplified, and cognitively biased.
  - Poorly matched to actual dog‑bite risk factors.
  - Difficult to enforce fairly due to unreliable breed ID.
- Argues for **breed‑neutral, behavior‑ and owner‑focused laws** instead.

## Major Sections & Main Ideas

- **Historical Breed Panics (Part II)**
  - 19th–20th c. cycles of “most dangerous breed”: spitz (rabies scare), bloodhounds (slavery), Newfoundlands, collies, St. Bernards, German shepherds, Dobermans, then pit bulls/Rottweilers.
  - Media myths and pseudoscience (e.g., heat causes rabies; “Arctic” dogs prone to rabies) drove past panics.

- **Modern Pit Bull Panic & BSL Spread**
  - 1980s media (Sports Illustrated “Beware of This Dog,” Time “Time Bombs on Legs”) framed pit bulls as criminal “weapons.”
  - Early U.S. BSL: Cincinnati (1983), Tijeras, NM (1984), Denver & Miami‑Dade (1989); UK Dangerous Dogs Act, Victoria (Australia), Spain, etc.
  - “Cycle of breed bias”: popularity → incidents → media fear → tough‑image owners → more problems & misID → bans.

- **Law & Policy Structure**
  - BSL forms: local bans/restrictions, registration + insurance + muzzling, state “vicious dog” definitions (e.g., Ohio 1987–2012), military housing bans.
  - State preemption: growing number of states bar local BSL; scope varies (dangerous‑dog laws, insurance, etc.).
  - Courts mostly uphold BSL under **rational basis**, often citing *Sentell* (qualified property interest in dogs) and early myth‑based cases.

- **Science of Aggression & Empirical BSL Evaluations (Part III)**
  - Canine aggression is **multifactorial**:
    - Key risk factors: isolation/resident status, abuse/neglect, poor supervision, children/other vulnerable victims, intact males, owner mismanagement.
  - Large epidemiological and behavioral studies (Australia, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, DBRF study) find:
    - **Breed is a weak predictor**; many breeds bite (86+ identified).
    - **No meaningful reduction** in dog bites or hospitalizations after BSL.
    - German temperament tests: “dangerous” breeds no more inappropriately aggressive than golden retrievers.
    - Dutch Bite Risk Index: some breeds overrepresented, some under, but removing even many breeds would not eliminate risk.

- **Genetics & Brain Chemistry**
  - Some serotonin/dopamine‑related haplotypes correlate with aggression, but:
    - Effects are **polygenic + environment‑dependent**.
    - Large within‑breed variation; no simple “dangerous breed gene.”

- **Breed Identification & DNA (Part IV)**
  - Visual breed ID is highly unreliable, even among professionals (Voith study: only 4/20 mixed‑breed dogs correctly ID’d by >50% of respondents).
  - BSL enforcement based on “looks like a pit bull” causes:
    - **Over‑inclusion** (non‑pit dogs labeled pit bulls).
    - **Under‑inclusion** (pit mixes that don’t “look” right ignored).
  - DNA testing shows frequent mismatch between appearance and ancestry, undermining attack statistics “by breed.”

- **Cognitive Bias, Media, and Moral Panic (Part V)**
  - **Dual‑process model**: fast, emotional System 1 vs slow, analytic System 2.
  - **Heuristics**:
    - Availability: vivid maulings, especially of children, make dog attacks seem common.
    - Affect: fear/disgust toward certain dogs/owners inflates perceived risk, depresses perceived benefit.
    - Probability neglect: people fixate on horrific outcomes, ignore their tiny probability (dog‑bite death ≈ lightning risk).
    - Representativeness & moral panic: pit bulls stereotype as “gang/drug” dogs; stigma of owners transfers to dogs.
    - Social cascades: fear spreads through networks and media, amplifying beyond evidence.
  - Result: BSL is a **fear response**, not serious risk management.

- **Policy Alternatives & Recommendations (Part VI)**
  - **Focus on co‑occurring risk factors**, not breed:
    - Strengthen and enforce abuse/neglect laws (including isolation as abuse).
    - Target mismanagement (running at large, lack of supervision around children).
    - Promote spay/neuter with “nudges” (fee differentials, low‑cost/paid programs).
    - Education: child‑focused dog‑safety curricula; owner education tied to licensing.
  - Recognize costs and inequities of BSL:
    - Emotional loss, housing instability, disparate impact on low‑income owners.
    - High enforcement costs with no proven safety gain.

- **Courts & Advocacy**
  - Call for **“rational basis with bite”**: courts should revisit BSL using current science, not outdated myths.
  - Emphasize unreliability of visual ID and weak fit between means (breed bans) and ends (bite reduction).

## Key Definitions / Formulas

- **Breed-Specific Legislation (BSL)**: Laws that regulate or ban dogs solely/primarily by breed or appearance.
- **Moral panic**: Public and state reaction vastly out of proportion to actual threat posed by a perceived danger group.
- **Resident dog vs family dog**: Isolated outdoor/sequestered dog vs integrated, interactive household pet.
- **Population Attributable Fraction % (PAF%)**: Breed’s share of total dog population (used—but often misused—to infer “dangerousness”).
- **Bite Risk Index**: (Fraction of biting dogs that are a breed) ÷ (fraction of total dog population that breed); average risk = 1.

## Representative Examples / Cases

- Historical: spitz rabies hysteria (NYT calling for extermination); bloodhounds in slavery and *Uncle Tom’s Cabin*; later stigmas for GSDs, Dobermans.
- Modern BSL: Cincinnati, Denver, Miami‑Dade, Winnipeg; UK Dangerous Dogs Act; Victoria (Australia); later repeals in Netherlands & Italy.
- Legal: *Sentell*; *Vanater*, *Dog Fanciers v. Denver*, *Garcia v. Tij
