**Main Ideas / Sections**

- **Rise of Fish Piracy in the Salish Sea**
  - Emerged late 19th–early 20th c. around Puget Sound/Fraser River.
  - Centered on theft from corporate **fish traps** and illegal fishing in restricted times/places.
  - Linked to Progressive Era “conservation,” expanding state regulation, and conflicts over who controlled a common resource.

- **Fish Traps, Corporate Power, and Space**
  - Traps = large, fixed installations intercepting migrating salmon; very capital‑intensive and extremely efficient (e.g., one Fidalgo trap caught ~200,000 fish in 1898).
  - By 1905 most Puget Sound traps owned by a few big canning firms (PAF, Fidalgo, Bellingham, etc.).
  - Corporations used:
    - Dense networks of **real, experimental, and dummy traps**.
    - Extra **set gill net licenses** to occupy coastline.
  - Result: effective **spatial monopolies**, blocking gillnetters/seiners and often occupying former Indigenous reef‑net sites.

- **Definitions / Key Concepts**
  - **Fish pirates / rustlers**: Poachers who stole salmon from traps, boats, docks, or fished illegally in closed time; usually small‑boat fishermen using local knowledge.
  - **Fish traps**: Fixed gear with long **leads** funneling salmon into holding pens.
  - **Common property doctrine**: Fish are owned by no one until captured; pirates used this to argue trapped fish were not yet private property.
  - **Dummy / experimental traps**: Traps maintained mainly to hold space and block competitors, not to maximize catch.
  - **Closed time / close season**: Weekly legal closure when traps were supposed to be open (not fishing); widely ignored.

- **Who Were the Pirates & How They Operated**
  - Mostly Euro‑American/Euro‑Canadian wage fishers; some Native and possibly Japanese participants.
  - Regularly moved between legal wage work and piracy.
  - Skills: night navigation without lights, intimate knowledge of reefs/currents, use of fog and bird behavior (e.g., cormorants) to locate traps.
  - Technology: adoption of **gas engines** increased speed/range and ability to outrun patrols.
  - Tactics:
    - Bribed **trap watchmen** ($100–$700 per load); low wages made watchmen prone to collusion.
    - Used **coded phone calls** to signal ripe traps.
    - Often targeted **big corporate traps**, sometimes selling to smaller canneries.

- **Economics of Piracy**
  - Extremely lucrative relative to legal fishing:
    - Hauls of ~2,500 fish/night; $600–$1,800 per load for pirates like Bert “Spider” Jones.
    - Pirates avoided many costs (gear, boat debt, company stores) borne by legal fishers.
  - Buyers:
    - Cannery tenders cruising boundary waters.
    - Some canneries knowingly bought stolen fish (“didn’t care where they got them”).
    - Companies at times hired pirates to steal from competitors’ traps.

- **Violence, Enforcement, and Law**
  - Escalating confrontations: armed watchmen, “shoot on sight” orders, gunfights, occasional deaths.
  - Corporate and state responses:
    - Extra watchmen, armed patrol boats, searchlights, coordination with Coast Guard/DMF.
    - High fences, gate guards, and searches at canneries.
  - Legal ambiguity:
    - Debate whether fish in traps were private property or still common.
    - Influential precedents: **Ohio v. Shaw (1902)** and later US federal cases treated trapped fish as property (larceny).
    - Washington lacked a specific anti‑piracy statute until **1915**, when stealing from traps/nets became a **gross misdemeanor** and watchmen could be fined for illegal fishing in closed time.

- **Cross‑Border (US–Canada) Dimension**
  - Pirates and gear thieves moved across the border to evade jurisdiction and seek better prices.
  - Both sides blamed “foreign pirates”; in practice, culprits often local.
  - Governments and canners exchanged information and tried price coordination, but enforcement remained weak.

- **Morality, Community, and “Conservation” Rhetoric**
  - Many local white communities sympathized with or even admired pirates; juries sometimes refused to convict.
  - Pirates framed themselves as:
    - Defenders of common rights against monopolistic traps.
    - Opponents of corporate **lawbreaking** (traps secretly fished during closed time).
    - Critics of trap “wastefulness” (bycatch, suffocation, continuous fishing).
  - Reality: all actors—traps, pirates, seiners, canners—contributed to **overproduction and massive waste** (e.g., scowloads of salmon dumped, millions of pounds of offal).

- **Larger Context: Labor, Class, and Gender**
  - Traps reduced demand for independent fishermen, pushing some white men toward cannery work alongside racialized/”women’s” labor, seen as a loss of masculine status.
  - Piracy served as a **labor strategy** and form of class resistance more than genuine conservation.
  - Older watchmen and displaced fishers, often with families and debts, were particularly prone to collude.

- **Common Pitfalls / Misconceptions**
  - Treating “conservation” law as neutral: in practice it often empowered big firms, marginalized Indigenous and small‑scale fishers, and was unevenly enforced.
  - Romanticizing pirates as environmentalists: they increased pressure on salmon and added to waste.
  - Seeing canneries only as victims: many bought pirated fish or encouraged illegal fishing by their own watchmen.
  - Assuming clear legality: before 1915 in WA, property rights in trapped fish and “fish piracy” as a crime were legally murky.
  - Ignoring structural causes: piracy grew from monopolistic trap systems, labor displacement, and deep class/gear conflicts—not just individual greed.
