**Main ideas / sections**

- **Nisqually River & Frank’s Landing**
  - River is the center of Nisqually life: tides, floods, salmon runs structure time and identity.
  - Frank’s Landing: small Nisqually community on the river; later “ground zero” of treaty-rights struggle and a moral center of tribal sovereignty.

- **Ecology, development, and salmon decline**
  - Salmon runs once abundant; kids caught flounder with their feet, witnessed huge runs.
  - Post‑WWII boom: Boeing, suburban growth, irrigated agriculture, massive logging (11× prewar harvest by 1965), dams, pesticides.
  - Result: sharp salmon declines; non‑Indian commercial and sport effort exploded while habitat was destroyed.

- **Criminalization of Indian fishing & Fish Wars**
  - 1930s–50s: Indians arrested for “illegal” (unlicensed, out‑of‑season) fishing despite treaty rights.
  - 1960s–70s “Fish Wars”: fish‑ins, river confrontations, mass arrests, tear gas, boat‑ramming; women and children central participants.
  - State framed this as neutral “conservation,” but enforcement was targeted and militarized, part of broader federal “termination” and assimilation policy.

- **Treaty rights, sovereignty, and law**
  - Treaties (Stevens Treaties, Medicine Creek) reserved tribal rights to fish at “usual and accustomed” places—federal law under the Supremacy Clause.
  - Tribes’ goals:
    1. Freedom from state regulation over treaty fishing.
    2. Recognition of tribal regulatory authority.
    3. A substantial, quantifiable share of the runs.
  - Key precedents:
    - *United States v. Winans* (1905): treaties read as tribes understood; fishing nearly as vital as air.
    - *Tulee v. Washington* (1942): state can’t force treaty fishers to buy licenses.
    - *Puyallup I & II* (1968, 1973): states may regulate for conservation, but not use “conservation” to mask allocation that disfavors tribal net fishing.

- **Movement leadership and strategy**
  - Billy Frank Jr.: Nisqually fisherman and arrest‑prone direct‑action leader (“not a policy guy”).
  - Maiselle Bridges and daughters (esp. Valerie): strategists and public voices framing rights as “supreme law of the land.”
  - Hank Adams (NIYC): key national strategist; organized mass rallies, crafted legal strategy, drove documentaries and the *Uncommon Controversy* report.
  - Allies included civil‑rights figures, celebrities (Brando, Dick Gregory), academics (Ralph Johnson), and student radicals.

- **Key litigation and the path to Boldt**
  - *Sohappy v. Smith / U.S. v. Oregon* (1969, Judge Belloni):
    - Affirms treaty rights override state law.
    - Introduces tribal right to a “fair share” of the harvestable fish (after escapement), but no number specified.
  - *United States v. Washington* (Boldt):
    - U.S. sues as federal trustee for Stevens treaty tribes.
    - Tribal and federal lawyers debate “fair share,” 50–50, and “actual needs.”
    - Evidence: anthropologist Barbara Lane, biologists, and elder testimony on treaty promises and fishing’s centrality.

- **The Boldt Decision (1974)**
  - Judge George Boldt’s 203‑page opinion:
    - Confirms treaties as binding federal law; interprets “in common with” as supporting strong tribal rights.
    - Allocates up to **50% of harvestable salmon and steelhead** at usual and accustomed grounds to treaty tribes.
    - Recognizes and requires **tribal sovereignty in fisheries management** (self‑regulation under federal oversight).
  - Legal status:
    - Affirmed by 9th Circuit; Supreme Court lets it stand; later Supreme Court likens Washington’s resistance to Southern resistance to desegregation.

- **Implementation, resistance, and co‑management**
  - Enforcement complexity: many tribes, users, rivers, species, and variable runs; need to estimate “harvestable” runs and manage ocean vs river fisheries.
  - Boldt appoints a scientific Court Advisor; issues hundreds of technical orders.
  - Massive non‑Indian resistance: illegal “outlaw” fisheries, hostile bumper stickers, ballot measures; state agencies and courts often refused to enforce closures.
  - Over time, intertribal commissions (e.g., Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission) form to blend traditional knowledge with modern science and co‑manage fisheries.

- **Billy Frank Jr.’s personal arc**
  - Marine Corps veteran; construction worker and lineman; limited formal schooling.
  - Faces repeated arrests and violence on the river.
  - Struggles with alcohol in the 1970s; niece Valerie’s urging and Boldt’s decision push him toward sobriety (treatment in 1974).
  - Endures family tragedy (death of daughter and granddaughter) but remains sober and active.
  - Builds a new family with Sue Crystal; teaches his son respect for people, earth, and women.
  - Shifts from protest leader to long‑term institution‑builder and salmon advocate.

**Key definitions**

- **Treaty rights**: Reserved rights (not granted rights) in 19th‑century treaties, including to fish at usual and accustomed places; superior to conflicting state law.
- **Harvestable portion**: Fish that can be caught after enough “escapement” is left for reproduction.
- **Fair share**: Belloni’s term for the tribal allocation; conceptually important but numerically vague.
- **Boldt 50–50 rule**: Judicially imposed equal division of harvestable fish between treaty tribes and non‑Indians.
- **Tribal sovereignty (fisheries)**: Tribes’ recognized authority to regulate their members and manage treaty fisheries.

**Core examples / cases**

- River confrontations on the Nisqually and Puyallup (raids, tear gas, children arrested).
- 1968 Budd Inlet protest showing gillnets’ limited catch despite visible salmon.
- 1970 Puyallup encampment raid (300 police, 62 arrested).
- *Sohappy v. Smith / U.S. v. Oregon* (1969) – “fair share.”
- *United States v. Washington* (1974) – Boldt Decision.
- Supreme Court’s 1979 comparison of Washington’s resistance to desegregation resistance.

**Pitfalls / common misconceptions**

- Blaming Indian fishing for salmon decline: text attributes decline mainly to dams,
