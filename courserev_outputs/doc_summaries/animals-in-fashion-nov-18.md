**Animals in (Human) Fashion – Hats, Fur, Fabric (Nov 18)**  

---

### 1. Sumptuary Laws & Fur Hierarchy  
**Main idea:** Clothing laws structured social hierarchy and controlled animal materials.  

- **Sumptuary laws** (medieval & early modern Europe):
  - Regulated who could wear luxury materials (furs, silk).
  - Reserved high‑status furs for elites; commoners restricted to “low-status” furs:
    - Goat, sheep, cat, dog, rabbit.
  - **Example:** Tudor England regulations specifying which ranks could wear which furs/fabrics.  
- **Pitfall:**  
  - These laws did *not* ban fur for commoners; they limited *which animals* and *quality* of fur.

### 2. Origins of the North American Fur Trade  
**Main idea:** Fur trade grew as a side activity of early fisheries.  

- European fishermen came for **cod**; while fish dried on shore they:
  - Traded knives, hooks, cloth, etc. with Indigenous peoples.
  - Received **pelts**, especially beaver, in return.
- Result:
  - Development of wide **trans-Native trading networks**.
  - Furs were moved long distances through Indigenous exchange before reaching Europeans.

### 3. Case Study – Beaver and Felt Hats  
**Species:**
- *Castor fiber* – Eurasian beaver.  
- *Castor canadensis* – North American beaver; main species in colonial trade.  

**Importance:**
- Described as “the most widespread and successful mammal” in North America at contact (Dolin).
- Central to **felt hat** manufacture in Europe.

**Beaver pelt grades (for hat-making):**
1. **Coat beaver (castor sec)**  
   - Pelts **worn as clothing for ≥1 year** before trade.  
   - **Guard hairs naturally worn off**, leaving dense underfur.  
   - Felts more easily; **most desirable** for fine hats.  

2. **Parchment beaver** (also sometimes called *castor sec*):
   - Freshly prepared skins, not previously worn.  
   - Still have **guard hairs**, which must be **plucked** before felting.  

**Pitfalls:**
- Term **“castor sec”** is used inconsistently:
  - Can mean used “coat beaver” or fresh “parchment beaver” depending on context.
- Intuitive but wrong assumption:
  - People think “new” fur is best.
  - For felt hats, **used coat beaver** is actually superior because guard hairs are gone.

**Shift in materials:**
- Early modern: **beaver felt** dominant.  
- Later: **silk and other fibers** increasingly replace beaver as beaver becomes scarce and fashions change.

### 4. Feathers & Millinery  
**Main idea:** Fashion hats used whole birds, not just loose feathers.  

- Millinery (hat-making) materials:
  - Not only single feathers but also **wings, heads, claws**, even **entire birds**.
  - Often dyed and carefully posed for dramatic effect.
- Consequence:
  - Massive demand for wild birds; some species driven toward or into **extirpation/extinction**.

**Common misconception:**
- That only scattered feathers were used.
- In reality, mounted whole birds or large parts were standard high-fashion decorations.

### 5. Legal Responses to Feather/Fur Millinery (U.S.-focused)  

- **1886–1909: American Ornithologists’ Union (AOU) model laws**
  - Template state laws to restrict hunting and plume trade.

- **1900: Lacey Act**
  - Bans **interstate trade** in wildlife taken in violation of state laws.
  - Among the first major **federal wildlife laws**.
  - Example: seizure of **2,600 gulls** from a Baltimore millinery shop.

- **1900–1905: Thayer Fund**
  - Philanthropic fund to hire more **game wardens** (esp. for seabirds).  
  - Strengthens enforcement rather than creating new prohibitions.

- **1903–1906: Voluntary millinery restrictions**
  - Some milliners pledge not to use certain threatened bird feathers.
  - Early case of **industry self-regulation** under public pressure.

- **1913: Underwood Tariff Bill**
  - Bans import of:
    - “feathers, quills, heads, wings, tails, skins, or parts of skins, of wild birds, either raw or manufactured,”  
    - Except **ostrich** and **domestic fowl**; exemptions for scientific/educational use.
  - Directly targets **fashion trade in wild bird parts**.

- **Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA)**  
  - Slides list 1913, but historically:
    - **1916**: U.S.–UK (Canada) migratory bird treaty.  
    - **1918**: U.S. **implementing law** (MBTA).  
  - Protects migratory birds; restricts hunting and commercial trade in their parts.

**Pitfall:**
- Confusion over MBTA date:
  - Remember: **Treaty 1916; U.S. law 1918**.
  - A 1913 date usually refers to related pre‑treaty legislation or simplification.

### 6. Broader Case – Fur, Leather, Wool  
- Slide indicates a third case but details not shown.
- Implied issues:
  - Distinctions between **wild vs domestic** animals.
  - **Necessity vs luxury** uses.
  - Functional materials (e.g., leather, wool) vs **status/fashion** uses (plumes, fine furs).

---

### 7. Overall Themes  
- Fashion has been a **major driver of animal exploitation** (fur, feathers, skins).  
- Human societies regulated animal materials first to enforce **social hierarchy** (sumptuary laws), later to address **conservation and cruelty** concerns.  
- Law, philanthropy, and consumer pressure interacted to reshape fashion practices.
