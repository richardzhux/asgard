**Protections on Wildlife – Summary**

---

### 1. State Fish & Game Agencies

- **Source of power:**  
  - Agencies derive authority from **enabling statutes** (legislation that creates and empowers them).  
- **Three main grounds to challenge agency action:**
  1. **Wrong kind of power (unconstitutional delegation):**  
     - Legislature cannot hand over pure lawmaking power without a guiding **statement of policy/standards**.
  2. **Beyond statutory bounds (ultra vires):**  
     - Agency cannot act beyond what the **enabling statute** authorizes.
  3. **Wrong procedures:**  
     - Even valid authority is invalidly used if agency fails to follow **required procedures** (notice-and-comment, hearings, etc.).

### 2. Enforcement of Game Laws

- **Mens rea (intent):**  
  - How much mental state is required to convict (strict liability vs. knowledge/intent)?  
  - Critical for deciding when conduct becomes criminal.
- **Prosecutorial discretion:**  
  - Agencies rely on prosecutors to decide **which violations to charge** and what penalties to seek.
- **Judicial interpretation:**  
  - Courts construe broad/vague language using **reasonableness** and can narrow overly harsh readings.
- **Constitutional challenges:**
  - **Void for vagueness:** law invalid if a reasonable person cannot tell what is prohibited.
  - **Overbreadth:** law covers too much innocent or protected conduct.
- **Core tension:**  
  - **Fairness vs. enforceability**: very clear, strict rules may be easy to enforce but risk unfair outcomes.

### 3. Example – Tennessee Baiting Statute

- **Statute (Tenn. Code § 70‑4‑113) – key idea:**  
  - Unlawful to “**make use of bait** … or other devices **for the purpose of** killing/injuring/capturing” protected wildlife.
- **Hypothetical scenarios:**
  - Sprinkling corn and hunting **out of season**.  
  - Sprinkling corn before season, hunting **after season opens**.  
  - Hunting in season where you **know** someone else baited.  
  - Hunting in season where you **don’t know** someone else baited.
- **Central questions:**
  - Does “**make use of bait**” require:
    - Personal placement of bait?  
    - Knowledge that bait is present?  
    - Intent to benefit from bait?  
  - Is merely hunting near bait (esp. unknowingly) illegal?
- **Pitfall:** assuming only the person who physically puts out bait is liable.

### 4. Searches & Checkpoints in Game Law

- **Game checkpoints:**
  - Used to verify **licenses, bag limits, and equipment**.  
  - Legal question: Are they like **Terry stops** (need reasonable suspicion) or like **DUI/border checkpoints** under the “special‑needs” doctrine (less individualized suspicion)?
- **Curtilage vs. open fields:**
  - **Curtilage:** area immediately around home; strong **Fourth Amendment** protection → generally need warrant or exception.  
  - **Open fields:** much less protection; game wardens often have broader authority to enter without warrant.

### 5. Lacey Act

- **Basic structure of a violation:**
  1. **Predicate illegality:** wildlife taken/possessed/transported/sold in violation of **some other law** (state, tribal, foreign, or federal).  
  2. Defendant then **imports/exports/transports/sells/receives/acquires/purchases** that wildlife; for state/tribal laws, there must be **interstate or foreign commerce**.
- **Mens rea tiers:**
  - **Civil:** liable if, exercising **due care, should have known** wildlife was illegal.  
  - **Misdemeanor:** above plus **knowingly** did the conduct.  
  - **Felony:** **knowing** involvement in (a) **purchase/sale** of illegal wildlife, or (b) **transportation across borders**.
- **Pitfall:**  
  - Violating a **foreign or state game rule** (e.g., size/season limit) can become a **federal Lacey Act crime**.

### 6. Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA)

- **Coverage:**
  - Applies to all FWS‑designated **migratory birds**.  
  - **Not covered:** birds permanently **captive‑raised and kept in captivity**.  
  - **Covered:** birds **released into the wild**, even if captive‑raised originally.
- **Types of killing:**
  - **Direct:** e.g., shooting birds.  
  - **Indirect:** industrial activities (pits, oil pits, power lines) leading to bird deaths. Courts split on how far this liability extends.
- **Duties of care:**  
  - Unclear line: what **reasonable measures** must actors take to avoid incidental bird deaths?
- **Bait and strict liability:**
  - In many MBTA baiting contexts, liability is close to **strict liability** (no need to prove intent/knowledge).
- **Penalties:**
  - **Misdemeanor:** typically strict‑liability or negligent offenses.  
  - **Felony:** requires certain **knowing** violations.

### 7. Migratory Bird Hunting Rules (Federal & State)

- **Sources:**
  - **Kentucky Hunting Guide** (simplified, hunter‑friendly).  
  - **50 C.F.R. § 20** (detailed federal regulation).
- **Regulatory topics:**
  - What counts as **baiting**, **bag limits**, species ID, seasons, shooting hours, legal equipment, etc.
- **Communication issues:**
  - State guides are simplified; hunters may **wrongly assume** they are the full law.  
  - Federal rules can be **technical and detailed**, creating risk of **unintentional violations**.
- **Common misconception:**  
  - “If it’s not in the state booklet, it’s legal.” Federal rules can impose **additional, stricter requirements**.
