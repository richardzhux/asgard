  - *Personal abode*: Principal home; not hunting camps, hotels, trailers used on trips.
  - *Migratory bird preservation facility*: Anyone (taxidermist, processor, hunting club, etc.) holding others’ birds for processing/storage/shipment.
  - *Normal agricultural planting/harvesting/post‑harvest manipulation/operation/soil stabilization*: Must follow **State Extension** recommendations; used to distinguish legal fields from **baited areas**.
  - *Baited area*: Where salt/grain/feed was placed so it could attract migratory game birds; remains baited **10 days after complete bait removal**.
  - *Baiting*: The act of placing/redistributing such feed to attract birds.
  - *Manipulation*: Mowing, discing, burning, etc. of crops/vegetation (not scattering stored grain).
